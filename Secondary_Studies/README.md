Secondary studies: 

Bibliographies produced during the preliminary assessment of secondary studies acquired in three consecutive steps: 
1. After the retrieval from the selected digital libraries (DLs). 
2. After an initial pruning (removal of some duplicates, etc.) performed through Zotero. Those bibliographies are in CSL JSON format. 
3. After the automatic evaluation, performed with the tool at https://github.com/TintoEdoardo/SLR-Support-Tool. The output format is CSL JSON.
