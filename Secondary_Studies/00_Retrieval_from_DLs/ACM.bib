abstract = {Distributed infrastructures for computation and analytics are now evolving towards an interconnected ecosystem allowing complex scientific workflows to be executed across hybrid systems spanning from IoT Edge devices to Clouds, and sometimes to supercomputers (the Computing Continuum). Understanding the performance trade-offs of large-scale workflows deployed on such complex Edge-to-Cloud Continuum is challenging. To achieve this, one needs to systematically perform experiments, to enable their reproducibility and allow other researchers to replicate the study and the obtained conclusions on different infrastructures. This breaks down to the tedious process of reconciling the numerous experimental requirements and constraints with low-level infrastructure design choices. To address the limitations of the main state-of-the-art approaches for distributed, collaborative experimentation, such as Google Colab, Kaggle, and Code Ocean, we propose KheOps, a collaborative environment specifically designed to enable cost-effective reproducibility and replicability of Edge-to-Cloud experiments. KheOps is composed of three core elements: (1) an experiment repository; (2) a notebook environment; and (3) a multi-platform experiment methodology. We illustrate KheOps with a real-life Edge-to-Cloud application. The evaluations explore the point of view of the authors of an experiment described in an article (who aim to make their experiments reproducible) and the perspective of their readers (who aim to replicate the experiment). The results show how KheOps helps authors to systematically perform repeatable and reproducible experiments on the Grid5000 + FIT IoT LAB testbeds. Furthermore, KheOps helps readers to cost-effectively replicate authors experiments in different infrastructures such as Chameleon Cloud + CHI@Edge testbeds, and obtain the same conclusions with high accuracies (&gt; 88% for all performance metrics).},

abstract = {Our growing reliance on edge-computing applications makes it crucial to improve the reliability of edge-computing systems. With multiple classes of edge-computing applications, different types of faults, and different kinds of resources needed by the applications, it remains unclear which resource exhaustion has the most disruptive impact on the latency experienced by the edge applications. Without this information, it is challenging to determine which faults to prioritize when implementing fault tolerance for edge computing. To address this challenge, we conduct an empirical study on a representative edge computing environment using well-known edge-computing benchmark applications (DeFog and ComB) and injecting resource-stressing faults (via stress-ng and hping). Our study reveals that memory overloads, CPU cache thrashing, frequent context switching, and page faults are the biggest disruptors of latency for edge-based applications.},

abstract = {Service Mesh Technologies (SMTs) are increasingly popular in simplifying the networking between microservices. They allow one to declaratively and programmatically define service-to-service policies and interactions, and take all sorts of network management logic (e.g., traffic splitting, request tracing, security, reliability) out of the application. This simplifies the development of microservice architectures, which are widely used in cloud and edge applications. However, the suitability for different SMTs for use in edge applications is unclear. Thus, this work compares the two most popular SMTs (Istio and Linkerd) in terms of performance and overhead for resource-constrained devices. Through extensive experimentation and comparing with a baseline of standard networking in a Kubernetes cluster, we identify that Linkerd offers a more edge-friendly SMT option in contrast to Istio. Overall, Istio's communications are ≈10% slower than Linkerd at an increased 1.2--1.4x more memory and ≈1.2x more CPU utilization.},

Serverless edge computing is a suitable candidate to manage the continuum by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, improving developers’ experiences, and optimizing overall resource utilization. However, understanding and overcoming programming support, reliability, and performance engineering challenges are essential for the success of serverless edge computing. In this article, we review and evaluate the maturity of serverless approaches for the edge–cloud continuum. Our review includes commercial, community-driven offerings and approaches from academia. We identify several maturity levels of serverless edge computing and use them as criteria to evaluate the maturity of current state-of-the-art serverless approaches with a special focus on the programming, reliability, and performance challenges. Finally, we lay a road map toward the next generation of serverless edge computing systems.},

abstract = {Emerging use-cases like smart manufacturing and smart cities pose challenges in terms of latency, which cannot be satisfied by traditional centralized infrastructure. Edge networks, which bring computational capacity closer to the users/clients, are a promising solution for supporting these critical low latency services. Different from traditional centralized networks, the edge is distributed by nature and is usually equipped with limited compute capacity. This creates a complex network to handle, subject to failures of different natures, that requires novel solutions to work in practice. To reduce complexity, edge application technology enablers, advanced infrastructure and application orchestration techniques need to be in place where AI and ML are key players.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, in the industrial sector we have witnessed the rise of a revolutionary movement, known as Industry 4.0, that promotes the digital transformation as the key to increase the competitiveness of manufacturing factories. Among the many technologies recognized as “drivers” of such revolutionary transition, microservices stand out as a software development paradigm capable of bringing several benefits to the manufacturing process. Whilst the literature offers many examples of initiatives exploiting microservices in digitally-advanced sectors (e.g., finance, telecommunication, retailing), its potential in the industrial manufacturing is yet to be fully unleashed. We conducted an extensive literature survey in the twofold aim of bringing to the reader’s attention the many benefits that the microservices paradigm may offer in industrial manufacturing settings, and drawing a picture of how light virtualization techniques are actually being exploited to achieve Industry 4.0 digitization goals. In this paper, we propose a structured analysis of the collected literature proposals which combines the benefits sought by authors when approaching to the microservices techniques and the specific scope of application of proposals. We conclude the paper highlighting the research aspects that have not been sufficiently explored in the literature and that would deserve further attention in the near future.},

abstract = {Deploying machine learning (ML) models to production with the same level of rigor and automation as traditional software systems has shown itself to be a non-trivial task, requiring extra care and infrastructure to deal with the additional challenges. Although many studies focus on adapting ML software engineering (SE) approaches and techniques, few studies have summarized the status and challenges of operationalizing ML models. Model operationalization encompasses all steps after model training and evaluation, including packaging the model in a format appropriate for deployment, publishing to a model registry or storage, integrating the model into a broader software system, serving, and monitoring. This study is the first systematic literature review investigating the techniques, tools, and infrastructures to operationalize ML models. After reviewing 24 primary studies, the results show that there are a number of tools for most use cases to operationalize ML models and cloud deployment in particular. The review also revealed several research opportunities, such as dynamic model-switching, continuous model-monitoring, and efficient edge ML deployments.},

abstract = {As the number of smart cars grows rapidly, vehicular crowdsensing (VCS) becomes gradually popular. In a VCS infrastructure, sensing devices and computing units hold on smart cars as well as cloud server form an IoT-edge-cloud continuum to perform real-time sensing tasks. In order to encourage the smart cars to participate the real-time VCS process, blockchain technology can be combined with VCS to provide automated incentive for VCS data trading without relying on trusted third parties. However, directly using blockchain to enforce VCS data trading process incurs expensive service fees and participants still can conduct various misbehavior. In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-based data trading system for VCS named BTT system to address the above issues. In particular, we first integrate the blockchain-based data trading process with a lightweight privacy-preserving truth discovery algorithm to ensure the accuracy of sensing data while preserving data privacy. we then propose a gas-aware optimization mechanism to minimize the gas consumption of the data trading process. Finally, we carefully design a distributed judgment mechanism to regulate all participants to behave correctly in the data trading process. To demonstrate the practicability of our design, we implement a prototype of BTT system deployed on Ethereum test network and conduct extensive simulations.},

abstract = {The evolution of Cloud Computing into a service utility, along with the pervasive adoption of the IoT paradigm, has promoted a significant growth in the need of computational and storage services. The traditional use of cloud services, focused on the consumption of one provider, is not valid anymore due to different shortcomings being the risk of vendor lock-in a critical. We are assisting to a change of paradigm, from the usage of a single cloud provider to the combination of multiple cloud service types, affecting the way in which applications are designed, developed, deployed and operated over such heterogeneous ecosystems. The result is an effective heterogeneity of architectures, methods, tools, and frameworks, copying with the multi-cloud application concept. The goal of this study is manifold. Firstly, it aims to characterize the multi-cloud concept from the application development perspective by reviewing existing definitions of multi-cloud native applications in the literature. Secondly, we set up the basis for the architectural characterization of these kind of applications. Finally, we highlight several open research issues drawn up from the analysis carried out. To achieve that, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), where, a large set of primary studies published between 2011 and 2021 have been studied and classified. The in-depth analysis has revealed five main research trends for the improvement of the development and operation DevOps lifecycle of “multi-cloud native applications”. The paper finishes with directions for future work and research challenges to be addressed by the software community.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.In this survey, we first introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurring in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging},

Cloud computing offering on-demand computing resources optimized to meet the needs of customers and their budgets is a promising technology for accelerating dynamic transcoding workloads. In this work, we propose OTEC, a novel multi-objective optimization method based on the mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the computing instance selection for transcoding processes. OTEC determines the type and number of cloud and fog resource instances for video encoding and transcoding tasks with optimized computation cost and time. We evaluated OTEC on AWS EC2 and Exoscale instances for various administrator priorities, the number of encoded video segments, and segment transcoding times. The results show that OTEC can achieve appropriate resource selections and satisfy the administrator's priorities in terms of time and cost minimization.},

Regarding the existing constraints and limitations in different components on the video delivery path from the origin server to clients, the network plays an essential role in boosting the perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) by clients. In other words, the network can enable us to optimize serving videos in the application layer by providing helpful information ranging from the status of clients' requests to the capacity of links. Therefore, the network can assist players or other entities (e.g., network edge servers) to make better decisions and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, selecting, collecting, analyzing, and leveraging network information to ensure the highest user quality of experience poses many fundamental challenges that attract researchers from both academia and industry.

abstract = {IoT edge computing is a new computing paradigm “in the IoT domain” for performing calculations and processing at the edge of the network, closer to the user and the source of the data. This paradigm is relatively recent, and, together with cloud and fog computing, there may be some confusion about its meaning and implications. This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers better understand what the industry thinks about what IoT edge computing is, and the expected benefits and challenges associated with this paradigm. We conducted a survey using a semi-structured in-depth questionnaire to collect qualitative data from relevant stakeholders from 29 multinational companies and qualitatively analyzed these data using the Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz) method. Several researchers participated in the coding process (collaborative coding). To ensure consensus on the constructs that support the theory and thus improve the rigor of qualitative research, we conducted an intercoder agreement analysis. From the analysis, we have derived a substantive and analytic theory of what companies perceive about IoT edge computing, its benefits and challenges. The theory is substantive in that the scope of validity refers to the 29 surveys processed and analytic in that it analyzes “what is” rather than explaining causality or attempting predictive generalizations. A public repository with all the data related to the information capture process and the products resulting from the analysis of this information is publicly available. This study aims to strengthen the evidence and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about why companies are adopting edge computing and the current challenges they face. Additionally, the testing theory phase shows that the results are aligned with the ISO/IEC TR 30164 standard.},

However, asset-heavy shopfloors, long machine replace cycles, and equipment heterogeneity demand major investments to achieve smart manufacturing, which small businesses struggle with. Retrofitting is a sustainable means of equipping aged machines with low-cost sensors and microcontrollers to read and forward machine data. In this paper, we present a concept and a prototype to retrofit industrial scenarios using lightweight web technologies on the edge. We propose using WebAssembly as a new bytecode standard that runs on browsers and bare-metal hardware alike, thus providing a uniform development environment from cloud to edge. We confirm its applicability by achieving near-native performance together with modularity known from container-based service architectures. Our prototype is evaluated with a real industrial robot within a showcase factory, including measurements of data exchange with a state-of-the-art data lake setup. We are convinced that our groundwork paves the way to an easier-to-implement and more sustainable Industry 4.0.},

abstract = {Cloud is an innovative model of the computing paradigm, where servers, networks, storage, development tools, and applications are enabled to the users through the Internet in the form of services. These services are provided by the cloud service providers (CSPs) by deploying virtual machines (VMs) as per the resource request received from the users. These VM requests are of various types and priorities, and therefore have varying impacts in terms of importance, criticality, accountability, and domains of applications. On the other hand, the resources/hosts are of varying sizes and assigned to the requests based on their capability, availability, and feasibility. Therefore, it is an exigent issue to map the VM requests with the hosts to maximize the allocation rate with respect to their priority. One of the recent solutions is to assign the high-priority VM requests in close proximity, and other requests can be assigned using first fit decreasing (FFD). However, this solution does not partition the hosts to discriminate the type of requests. This paper introduces a priority-aware resource allocation (PARA) algorithm to consider three types of VM requests: highly critical, critical, and normal, and partition the hosts into three levels. PARA enables the high-priority VM requests to a relatively large pool of hosts compared to low-priority requests.

abstract = {We study the performance exhibited by transport protocols, TCP and QUIC, over realistic satellite networks. We propose a novel methodology, which combines real implementation (exploiting virtualization techniques) and simulation, to carry out systematic and repetitive experiments. We modify the default operation of the ns-3 framework and we integrate the dynamism that characterizes links in satellite communications, particularly links to LEO satellites. We carry out a thorough assessment over different setups, changing the operating band and the buffer length. In addition, we ascertain the impact of using the multi-streaming feature that QUIC includes. The results show that QUIC yields lower delays than TCP, although in particular setups it might suffer from higher jitter. In addition, using multiple streams in QUIC does not yield a relevant gain. In any case, we can conclude that the behavior of transport protocols over non-terrestrial-networks might not be always optimum and that QUIC can bring benefits when compared to TCP.},

abstract = {The concept of digital twins has emerged from the smart manufacturing space and is now gaining adoption in many other industries beyond manufacturing. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a cyber-physical system that is used to capture the state of the system and to allow reason and decision-making on that state. While there has been much research on this topic, there is less work on the overall lifecycle ecosystem that supports the smooth interoperation of a physical facility (like a machine, a factory or even a supply chain) and its digital components (like data, processes and digital twins), which is called the Digital Thread. The aim of the Digital Thread is the creation of a digital lifecycle ecosystem that links together the data generated throughout a product’s lifecycle and represents the data, processes and communication platform that supports a product and its production at any instance of time.},

abstract = {Manufacturing has enabled the mechanized mass production of the same (or similar) products by replacing craftsmen with assembly lines of machines. The quality of each product in an assembly line greatly hinges on continual observation and error compensation during machining using sensors that measure quantities such as position and torque of a cutting tool and vibrations due to possible imperfections in the cutting tool and raw material. Patterns observed in sensor data from a (near-)optimal production cycle should ideally recur in subsequent production cycles with minimal deviation. Manually labeling and comparing such patterns is an insurmountable task due to the massive amount of streaming data that can be generated from a production process. We present UDAVA, an unsupervised machine learning pipeline that automatically discovers process behavior patterns in sensor data for a reference production cycle. UDAVA performs clustering of reduced dimensionality summary statistics of raw sensor data to enable high-speed clustering of dense time-series data. It deploys the model as a service to verify batch data from subsequent production cycles to detect recurring behavior patterns and quantify deviation from the reference behavior. We have evaluated UDAVA from an AI Engineering perspective using two industrial case studies.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) aims to make an environment more innovative and productive by connecting physical things to the internet. Processing generated data from IoT devices and actuation warranted in real-time requires computational infrastructure near the edge to get the outcome without delay. Emerging edge technologies such as Fog computing, Multi-Access Edge Computing, and Cloudlet provide computing resources near the edge, i.e. closer to the IoT devices, where devices can place their services/applications or offload their computational job for processing. The utilization of computing resources provided by emerging edge technologies addresses the issue of delay in the outcome and increases the battery life of IoT devices/End-user devices. Computational resources provided by the edge technologies, i.e. edge/fog nodes, can be heterogeneous, dynamic and mobile. Therefore, service placement and computation offloading on edge/fog nodes are challenging issues, and the problem to finding the best suitable fog/edge nodes is NP-Hard. Nature-inspired algorithms provide robust solutions to NP-Hard problems. Nowadays, nature-inspired algorithms have been widely applied for resource allocation for service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge technologies. In this work, we provide a detailed study on the applications of nature-inspired algorithms in emerging edge computing domains. We provide an overview of emerging edge technologies, related quality parameters and nature-inspired algorithms followed by the basic formulation of service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge computing systems. In this work, we classify the works in emerging edge computing applying nature-inspired algorithms into two categories: works related to service placement and works related to offloading. We provide a thorough review and comparison of the existing nature-inspired approaches in each category. We discuss various open issues at the end to set future research directions.},

abstract = {Achieving sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction and resource utilization are always a bottleneck for resource providers, especially when trying to meet the computing needs of resource hungry applications in mobile edge-cloud (MEC) continuum. Recent research uses metaheuristic techniques to allocate resources to large-scale applications in MECs. However, some challenges attributed to the metaheuristic techniques include entrapment at the local optima caused by premature convergence and imbalance between the local and global searches. These may affect resource allocation in MECs if continually implemented. To address these concerns and ensure efficient resource allocation in MECs, we propose a fruit fly-based simulated annealing optimization scheme (FSAOS) to serve as a potential solution. In the proposed scheme, the simulated annealing is incorporated to balance between the global and local search and to overcome its premature convergence. We also introduce a trade-off factor to allow application owners to select the best service quality that will minimize their execution cost. Implementation of the FSAOS is carried out on EdgeCloudSim Simulator tool. Simulation results show that the FSAOS can schedule resources effectively based on tasks requirement by returning minimum makespan and execution costs, and achieve better resource utilization compared to the conventional fruit fly optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization. To further unveil how efficient the FSAOSs, a statistical analysis based on 95% confidential interval is carried out. Numerical results show that FSAOS outperforms the benchmark schemes by achieving higher confidence level. This is an indication that the proposed FSAOS can provide efficient resource allocation in MECs while meeting customers’ aspirations as well as that of the resource providers.},

Indeed, MEC is opening up in the direction of reducing both interaction delays and data sharing, called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). In the near fu- ture, edge technologies will be a fundamental tool to better support time-dependent and data-intensive applications. In this context, this work explores existing and emerging platforms for MEC and human-centric applications, and proposes a suitable architecture that can be used in the context of autonomous vehicle systems.The proposed architecture will support scalable communication among sensing devices and edge/cloud computing platforms, as well as orchestrate services for computing, storage, and learning with the use of an Information-centric paradigm such as Apache Kafka},

abstract = {The edge-cloud continuum is an advanced paradigm for cloud computing, which brings data storage and compute power closer to users or devices, and as a result, eliminates lag time and saves bandwidth. However, this new paradigm is harsh for secure storage and computation due to the separation of data ownership and control. Data security, especially outsourced data integrity in the edge-cloud resilient network, becomes one of the most fundamental challenges. To check the outsourced data integrity and address the efficient key update issue in this scenario, in this article, we propose a framework of outsourced data integrity checking with a practical key update in the edge-cloud resilient network. We first review the existing outsourced data integrity checking algorithms and then put forward a potential solution to achieving outsourced data integrity checking with a practical key update, which is composed of three phases, namely key request and update, local data upload, and outsourced data integrity auditing. We implement a prototype system for our proposal as well, which demonstrates its practicality.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the increasing number of devices connected to the internet has allowed the development of new technologies for distributed computing. IoT devices have reached computing capacities superior to personal computers of a few years ago, and their small size, low cost and lower energy consumption have made them fundamental for the new technological evolution. This paper analyzes and compares different solutions of serverless paradigms focused on dynamic behaviour adaptation, based on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) framework. To allow a rapid interoperability of on-demand services, we propose a solution based on Blockchain, named BCB-FaaS, to ensure trustiness and accountability of function configuration, providing a strong barrier to well-known cyber-attacks. In addition, a cost analysis has been performed demonstrating how Blockchain can be an economic alternative to secure decentralized communications.},

abstract = {Osmotic computing in association with related computing paradigms (cloud, fog, and edge) emerges as a promising solution for handling bulk of security-critical as well as latency-sensitive data generated by the digital devices. It is a growing research domain that studies deployment, migration, and optimization of applications in the form of microservices across cloud/edge infrastructure. It presents dynamically tailored microservices in technology-centric environments by exploiting edge and cloud platforms. Osmotic computing promotes digital transformation and furnishes benefits to transportation, smart cities, education, and healthcare. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of osmotic computing through a systematic literature review approach. To ensure high-quality review, we conduct an advanced search on numerous digital libraries to extracting related studies. The advanced search strategy identifies 99 studies, from which 29 relevant studies are selected for a thorough review. We present a summary of applications in osmotic computing build on their key features. On the basis of the observations, we outline the research challenges for the applications in this research field. Finally, we discuss the security issues resolved and unresolved in osmotic computing.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been developed in many industrial sectors and application domains in which the quality requirements of data acquired are a common factor. Data quality in CPS can deteriorate because of several factors such as sensor faults and failures due to operating in harsh and uncertain environments. How can software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) help manage and tame data quality issues in CPS? This is the question we aimed to investigate in the SEA4DQ workshop. Emerging trends in software engineering need to take data quality management seriously as CPS are increasingly datacentric in their approach to acquiring and processing data along the edge-fog-cloud continuum. This workshop provided researchers and practitioners a forum for exchanging ideas, experiences, understanding of the problems, visions for the future, and promising solutions to the problems in data quality in CPS. Examples of topics include software/hardware architectures and frameworks for data quality management in CPS; software engineering and AI to detect anomalies in CPS data or to repair erroneous CPS data. SEA4DQ 2021, which took place on August 24th, 2021 was a satellite event of the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC / FSE) 2021. The workshop attracted 35 international participants and was exciting with a great keynote, six excellent presentations, and concluded on a high note with a panel discussion. SEA4DQ was motivated by the common research interests from the EU projects for Zero-Defects Manufacturing such as InterQ and Dat4.Zero.},

abstract = {Software-defined networking decouples control and data plane in softwarized networks. This allows for centralized management of the network, but complete centralization of the controller functions raises potential issues related to failure, latency, and scalability. Distributed controller deployment is adopted to optimize scalability and latency problems. However, existing controllers are monolithic, resulting in code inefficiency for distributed deployment. Some seminal ongoing efforts have been proposed with the idea of disaggregating the SDN controller architecture into an assembly of various subsystems, each of which can be responsible for a certain controller task. These subsystems are typically implemented as microservices and deployed as virtual network functions, in particular as Docker Containers. This enables flexible deployment of controller functions. However, these proposals (e.g., μONOS) are still in their early stage of design and development, so that a full decomposition of the SDN controller is not been available yet. To fill that gap, this article derives some important design guidelines to decompose an SDN controller into a set of microservices. Next, it also proposes a microservices-based decomposed controller architecture, foreseeing communications issues between the controller sub-functions. These design and performance considerations are also proven via the implementation of the proposed architecture as a solution, called Micro-Services based SDN controller (MSN), based on the Ryu SDN controller. Moreover, MSN includes different network communication protocols, such as gRPC, WebSocket, and REST-API. Finally, we show experimental results that highlight the robustness and latency of the system on a networking testbed. Collected results prove the main pros and cons of each network communication protocol and an evaluation of our proposal in terms of system resilience, scalability and latency.},

abstract = {This work sets out by exploiting the NECOS Cloud-Network Slicing concept to form the Cloud-to-Things continuum. We adopt the Network-Slicing Management and Orchestration (NS-MANO) approach, a set of building blocks that integrates the NECOS platform to fill the gap caused by a lack of multi-domain Network-Slicing capability support. The NS-MANO harnesses Softwarization and Cloudification facilities to automatically provision elastic Network-Slice parts that span across the backhauling, fronthauling, and Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructures of federated multi-domains. Additionally, NS-MANO binds all Network-Slice parts together into NECOS previously-orchestrated Cloud-Network Slice parts that form a full end-to-end Cloud-Network Slice instance. We designed a prototype atop a real-world testbed to check the NECOS/NS-MANO holistic architecture conformance, functional effectiveness, and performance impact. The findings suggest that the prototype offers an effective means of laying the foundations for an end-to-end Cloud-Network Slice lifecycle while keeping mobile users perceiving affordable quality over time. Additionally, we estimate the prototype cost through quantitative analysis on response times and signaling overhead along the experiment time.},

The convergence of a large number of nodes at the IoT edge along with multiple service providers and network operators exposes data owners and resource providers to potential threats. To address cloud-edge risks, trust-based decentralized management is needed. Blockchain technology has created an opportunity to decentralize IoT ecosystems, through its intrinsic properties and together with machine learning (ML) it can be used to provide a trusted backbone for managing IoT ecosystems to support automated and adaptive trust management. This paper presents a novel approach for crosslayer intelligent trust computation modelling leveraging ML and Blockchain for decentralized trust management in IoT ecosystems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for flow-based trust assessment is demonstrated using the Hyperledger Framework and the Cooja-based simulation environment. Finally, an initial evaluation is presented to understand the performance in terms of scalability and trust convergence of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Government now-a-days are looking forward to achieve “Energy for All” standards. Countries are committing themselves to reduce carbon emissions. Recently, every IT industry giants, who typically own and operate huge Data Centers (DC) are looking forward to achieve “100% usage of green energy to power their datacenters, contribute to the utility grid in equivalence&nbsp;to their electrical power&nbsp;consumptions”. Electrification and gradual decarbonisation still continue as significant, global concern. Hence it is pretty clear that need for MicroGrid (MG) based facilities is actually a&nbsp;mandatory. But intermittent-characteristic (unreliability/unavailability) of Renewable-Energy (RE) generating sources (like Solar Panels, Wind Turbines)&nbsp;regularly hinder both the stake holders-Government and IT industry from accomplishing such social and economic initiatives. Hence SmartMicroGrid (SMG) connected with utility grid&nbsp;are envisioned to support powering industries inorder to avoid future power outages. Interconnected industry4.0 factories where, actually the smart-management interms of two-way power supply and two-way communication network is foreseen. They are highly dependent on modern, integrated, Information and Communication technologies (IoT sensors, Fog and Cloud computing etc.). In this paper we have focussed on two objectives. Firstly our objective is to identify, optimum renewable-generation-capacities inorder to minimise investment cost of a microgrid. Secondly our objective is to maximize usage of more clean energy for applications running on FogMicroDataCenter (fogMDC), powered by microgrids and controlled by Sofware Defined Networking (SDN). We have used realistic meteorological data of Tamil nadu, India for our proposed work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposed for two different scenarios, performance modelling and economic modelling aiding MG powered FogMDCs. Proposed economic modelling work is related to finding, the optimum sizing of distributed energy resources and financial cost. Proposed&nbsp;performance modelling is about, the clean energy usages in&nbsp;micro grid powered fogMDC for operations, supported by SDN for efficient distributed Virtual Machine (VM) based resource utilization to guarantee QoS in time sensitive IoT applications.},

abstract = {Person re-identification (ReID) aims to re-identify a person from non-overlapping camera views. Since person ReID data contains sensitive personal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging distributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However, existing studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to obtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of cloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign computation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict suitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server aggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID datasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also reduces computation cost by 29%. Our FedUReID system with the joint optimization will shed light on implementing federated learning to more multimedia tasks without data labels.},

This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.},

abstract = {Fog computing provides a distributed computing paradigm that executes interactive and distributed applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Large-scale scientific applications, often in the form of workflow ensembles, have a distributed and interactive nature that demands a dispersed execution environment like fog computing. However, handling a large-scale application in heterogeneous environment of fog computing requires harmonizing heterologous resources over the continuum from the IoT to the cloud. This paper investigates offloading and task allocation problems for orchestrating the resources in a fog computing environment where the IoT application is considered in the form of workflow ensembles. We called Offload-Location a mechanism which has been designed to find offloading coalition structure alongside a matching algorithm for allocating the offloaded tasks to fog/cloud resources. The introduced solution attempts to minimize the execution time and minimize the price paid to servers for executing the tasks provided that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the ensemble’s deadline and budget are retaining. These objectives lead to maximizing the number of completed workflows of the ensemble as an ultimate goal. The appropriate performance of this mechanism is studied under different workflow applications and circumstances.},

abstract = {Stream Processing (SP), i.e., the processing of data in motion, as soon as it becomes available, is a hot topic in cloud computing. Various SP stacks exist today, with applications ranging from IoT analytics to processing of payment transactions. The backbone of said stacks are Stream Processing Engines (SPEs), software packages offering a high-level programming model and scalable execution of data stream processing pipelines. SPEs have been traditionally developed to work inside a single datacenter, and optimised for speed. With the advent of Fog computing, however, the processing of data streams needs to be carried out over multiple geographically distributed computing sites: Data gets typically pre-processed close to where they are generated, then aggregated at intermediate nodes, and finally globally and persistently stored in the Cloud. SPEs were not designed to address these new scenarios. In this paper, we argue that large scale Fog-based stream processing should rely on the coordinated composition of geographically dispersed SPE instances. We propose an architecture based on the composition of multiple SPE instances and their communication via distributed message brokers. We introduce SpecK, a tool to automate the deployment and adaptation of pipelines over a Fog computing platform. Given a description of the pipeline, SpecK covers all the operations needed to deploy a stream processing computation over the different SPE instances targeted, using their own APIs and establishing the required communication channels to forward data among them. A prototypical implementation of SpecK is presented, and its performance is evaluated over Grid’5000, a large-scale, distributed experimental facility.},

abstract = {Edge computing is the next Internet frontier that will leverage computing resources located near users, sensors, and data stores to provide more responsive services. Therefore, it is envisioned that a large-scale, geographically dispersed, and resource-rich distributed system will emerge and play a key role in the future Internet. However, given the loosely coupled nature of such complex systems, their operational conditions are expected to change significantly over time. In this context, the performance characteristics of such systems will need to be captured rapidly, which is referred to as performance benchmarking, for application deployment, resource orchestration, and adaptive decision-making. Edge performance benchmarking is a nascent research avenue that has started gaining momentum over the past five years. This article first reviews articles published over the past three decades to trace the history of performance benchmarking from tightly coupled to loosely coupled systems. It then systematically classifies previous research to identify the system under test, techniques analyzed, and benchmark runtime in edge performance benchmarking.},

abstract = {Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.},

abstract = {Born from a need for a pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications. Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage, for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms, and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering Edge computing.},

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.},

This work introduces a novel Smart Contract (SC) based architecture that provides for SLA management among relevant entities and actors in a decentralised computing environment: Virtual Machines (VMs), Cloud service consumers and Cloud providers. Its key components are especially designed SC functions, a trustless Smart Oracle (Chainlink) and a probabilistic Markov Decision Process. The novel architecture is implemented on Ethereum ledger (testnet). The results show its feasibility for SLA management including low costs operation within dynamic and decentralised Edge-to-Cloud federations.},

The proposed system is composed of two functionalities: ThingVisor and vSilo, and it aims at decoupling IoT device providers and IoT application developers. ThingVisor enables to produce virtual IoT devices, or Virtual Things, from physical IoT devices for sharing the physical devices among cross-domain IoT applications. In addition, vSilo enables to bridge between such Virtual Things and IoT applications for the interoperability of cross-domain IoT devices. In this paper, in order to enhance the VirIoT system, we propose ThingVisor Factory that helps to design ThingVisors in a user-friendly way and deploy them on demand autonomously by following container orchestration methodologies, such as Kubernetes. ThingVisor Factory is based on two concepts: dataflow programming-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) and service function chaining-based ThingVisor development.},

We propose a distributed control type function selection method. In order to implement this method, it is necessary to extend interest packet, data packet and forwarding of each node. We compared the existing method and the proposed method using ndnSIM, which is an NDN network simulator. The results of the proposed method are close to those of the method that requires the coordinator in terms of service execution delay and load balancing.},

abstract = {Unikernels are a new lightweight virtualization technology born as an alternative to virtual machines and containers. Geared towards service provisioning for the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, they offer extremely small memory footprint and strong isolation properties. However, the unikernels ecosystem is still in its infancy and lacks quintessential functionalities found in more well-established virtualization technologies. For example, stateful migration is a highly desired feature for mobile edge services in distributed environments which is not yet supported by unikernels. This is one of the shortcomings preventing us from reaping the full benefits of unikernels outside of stateless applications.In this work, we aim bridging this gap with MirageManager: a ready-to-deploy unikernel migration system enabling lossless migration supported by a function-level, application logic check-pointing library of our design. Our evaluation results show that MirageManager is able to lower the service downtime by ~80%, and drastically reduce the state transfer data by almost ~100% when comparing against Podman. Additionally, MirageManager also beats Podman, a container-based engine, in parallel service migration across constrained edge networks reducing the overall migration time by up to ~6x.},

In this work, we propose a novel Pareto-based approach for application placement close to the data sources called Multi-objective IoT Application Placement in fOg (MAPO). MAPO models applications based on a finite state machine using three conflicting optimization objectives, completion time, energy consumption, and economic cost, and considering both the computation and communication aspects. In contrast to existing solutions that optimize a single objective, MAPO enables multi-objective energy and cost-aware application placement. To evaluate the quality of the MAPO placements, we created both simulated and real-world testbeds tailored for a set of medical IoT application case studies. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, MAPO reduces the economic cost by 28%, while decreasing the energy requirements by 29-64% on average, and improves the completion time by a factor of six.},

abstract = {Today's industrial automation systems are undergoing a digital transformation that implies a shift towards the Internet of Things (IoT), leading to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm. Existing Industrial Automated Control Systems (IACS), enriched with a potentially large number of IoT devices are expected to make systems more efficient, flexible, provide intelligence, and ultimately enable autonomous control. In general, the majority of such systems come with high level of criticality that calls for well-established methods and approaches when achieving cybersecurity, preferably prescribed by a standard.IEC 62443 is an industrial standard that provides procedures to manage risks related to cybersecurity threats in IACS. Given the new IIoT paradigm, it is likely that existing standards are not sufficiently aligned with the challenges related to developing and maintaining cybersecurity in such systems. In this paper we review the applicability of the IEC 62443 standard in IIoT contexts and discuss potential challenges the process owners might encounter.Our analysis underlines that some areas within the standard could prove difficult to reach compliance with. In particular, handling of cross zone communication and software updates require additional guidance.},

Nevertheless, the ever-increasing computing capacities present on smart connected things and devices calls for the decentralisation of Cloud computing to avoid unnecessary latencies and fully exploit accessible computing capacities at the edges of the network. Whilst these decentralised Cloud models represent a significant breakthrough from a Cloud perspective, they are rooted in existing research areas such as Mobile Cloud Computing, Mobile Ad hoc Computing, and Edge computing.

abstract = {Internet-of-Things and machine learning promise a new era for healthcare.
The emergence of transformative technologies, such as Implantable
and Wearable Medical Devices (IWMDs), has enabled collection and
analysis of physiological signals from anyone anywhere anytime. Machine
learning allows us to unearth patterns in these signals and make healthcare
predictions in both daily and clinical situations. This broadens the
reach of healthcare from conventional clinical contexts to pervasive everyday
scenarios, from passive data collection to active decision-making.
Despite the existence of a rich literature on IWMD-based and clinical
healthcare systems, the fundamental challenges associated with
design and implementation of smart healthcare systems have not been
well-addressed. The main objectives of this article are to define a standard
framework for smart healthcare aimed at both daily and clinical
settings, investigate state-of-the-art smart healthcare systems and their
constituent components, discuss various considerations and challenges
that should be taken into account while designing smart healthcare systems,
explain how existing studies have tackled these design challenges,
and finally suggest some avenues for future research based on a set of
open issues and challenges.},

abstract = {In the emerging area of the Internet of Things (IoT), the exponential growth of the number of smart devices leads to a growing need for efficient data storage mechanisms. Cloud Computing was an efficient solution so far to store and manipulate such huge amount of data. However, in the next years it is expected that Cloud Computing will be unable to handle the huge amount of the IoT devices efficiently due to bandwidth limitations. An arising technology which promises to overwhelm many drawbacks in large-scale networks in IoT is Fog Computing. Fog Computing provides high-quality Cloud services in the physical proximity of mobile users. Computational power and storage capacity could be offered from the Fog, with low latency and high bandwidth. This survey discusses the main features of Fog Computing, introduces representative simulators and tools, highlights the benefits of Fog Computing in line with the applications of large-scale IoT networks, and identifies various aspects of issues we may encounter when designing and implementing social IoT systems in the context of the Fog Computing paradigm. The rationale behind this work lies in the data storage discussion which is performed by taking into account the importance of storage capabilities in modern Fog Computing systems. In addition, we provide a comprehensive comparison among previously developed distributed data storage systems which consist of a promising solution for data storage allocation in Fog Computing.},

With increasing lead times from equipment suppliers and increasing complexity in forecasting market demand, optimizing capital investment decisions is a significant managerial challenge. In response to this challenge, we developed a capital supply chain velocity program for ordering, shipping, and installing production equipment. At the core of this velocity program is a new and additional procurement framework that enables Intel to purchase options from its equipment suppliers for a faster delivery of some equipment. The framework seamlessly combines statistical forecasting with Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic programming to determine the number of options Intel should procure and exercise, and it includes built-in scenario and sensitivity analysis capabilities to support Intel’s contract selection, options reservation, and equipment procurement decisions. The velocity program and the framework provided Intel with hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings and at least $2 billion in revenue upside during a recent period of global economic crisis.},
