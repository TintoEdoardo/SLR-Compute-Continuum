Those bibliographies were extracted from the selected digital libraries at the end of the process to assess the replicability of the selection procedure. 
We tried to match the initial extraction date as closely as possible, but unfortunately, it spans several days; hence, we could not match it perfectly. 
As a result, the output is slightly larger than the one used in this work, by less than 40 articles.
