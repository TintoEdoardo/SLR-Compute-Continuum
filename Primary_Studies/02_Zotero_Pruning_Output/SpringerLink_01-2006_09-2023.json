		"abstract": "Over the past decade, in the industrial sector we have witnessed the rise of a revolutionary movement, known as Industry 4.0, that promotes the digital transformation as the key to increase the competitiveness of manufacturing factories. Among the many technologies recognized as “drivers” of such revolutionary transition, microservices stand out as a software development paradigm capable of bringing several benefits to the manufacturing process. Whilst the literature offers many examples of initiatives exploiting microservices in digitally-advanced sectors (e.g., finance, telecommunication, retailing), its potential in the industrial manufacturing is yet to be fully unleashed. We conducted an extensive literature survey in the twofold aim of bringing to the reader’s attention the many benefits that the microservices paradigm may offer in industrial manufacturing settings, and drawing a picture of how light virtualization techniques are actually being exploited to achieve Industry 4.0 digitization goals. In this paper, we propose a structured analysis of the collected literature proposals which combines the benefits sought by authors when approaching to the microservices techniques and the specific scope of application of proposals. We conclude the paper highlighting the research aspects that have not been sufficiently explored in the literature and that would deserve further attention in the near future.",

		"abstract": "The evolution of Cloud Computing into a service utility, along with the pervasive adoption of the IoT paradigm, has promoted a significant growth in the need of computational and storage services. The traditional use of cloud services, focused on the consumption of one provider, is not valid anymore due to different shortcomings being the risk of vendor lock-in a critical. We are assisting to a change of paradigm, from the usage of a single cloud provider to the combination of multiple cloud service types, affecting the way in which applications are designed, developed, deployed and operated over such heterogeneous ecosystems. The result is an effective heterogeneity of architectures, methods, tools, and frameworks, copying with the multi-cloud application concept. The goal of this study is manifold. Firstly, it aims to characterize the multi-cloud concept from the application development perspective by reviewing existing definitions of multi-cloud native applications in the literature. Secondly, we set up the basis for the architectural characterization of these kind of applications. Finally, we highlight several open research issues drawn up from the analysis carried out. To achieve that, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), where, a large set of primary studies published between 2011 and 2021 have been studied and classified. The in-depth analysis has revealed five main research trends for the improvement of the development and operation DevOps lifecycle of “multi-cloud native applications”. The paper finishes with directions for future work and research challenges to be addressed by the software community.",

MLOps is targeted to have the same impact on software development as DevOps had in the last decade. Objectives. The goal of the research is threefold: (RQ1) to analyze which MLOps tools and platforms can be used in the Cognitive Cloud Continuum, (RQ2) to investigate which combination of such tools and platforms is more beneficial, and (RQ3) to define how to distribute MLOps to nodes across the Cognitive Cloud Continuum. Methods. The work can be divided into three main blocks: analysis, proposal and identification, and application. The first part builds the foundations of the work, the second proposes a vision on the evolution of MLOps then identifies the key concepts while the third validates the previous steps through practical applications. Contribution. The thesis’s contribution is a set of MLOps pipelines that practitioners could adopt in different contexts and a practical implementation of an MLOps system in the Cognitive Cloud Continuum.",

		"abstract": "Tapping into previously inaccessible data sources promises new potential for value creation in the manufacturing industry. However, asset-heavy shopfloors, long machine replace cycles, and equipment heterogeneity demand major investments to achieve smart manufacturing, which small businesses struggle with. Retrofitting is a sustainable means of equipping aged machines with low-cost sensors and microcontrollers to read and forward machine data. In this paper, we present a concept and a prototype to retrofit industrial scenarios using lightweight web technologies on the edge. We propose using WebAssembly as a new bytecode standard that runs on browsers and bare-metal hardware alike, thus providing a uniform development environment from cloud to edge. We confirm its applicability by achieving near-native performance together with modularity known from container-based service architectures. Our prototype is evaluated with a real industrial robot within a showcase factory, including measurements of data exchange with a state-of-the-art data lake setup. We are convinced that our groundwork paves the way to an easier-to-implement and more sustainable Industry 4.0.",

		"abstract": "In the early 2000s, service-oriented architectures (SOA) emerged as a paradigm for distributed computing, e-business processing, and enterprise integration. Rapidly, SOA and web services became the subject of hype, and virtually every organization tried to adopt them, no matter their actual suitability. Even worse, there were nearly as many definitions of SOA as people adopting it. This led to a big fail on many of those attempts, as they tried to change the problem to fit the solution. Nowadays, microservices are the new weapon of choice to achieve the same (and even more) goals posed to SOA years ago. Microservices (“SOA done right”) describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services, bringing dynamism, modularity, distributed development, and integration of heterogeneous systems. However, nothing comes for free: new (and old) challenges appeared, including service design and specification, data integrity, and consistency management. In this chapter, we identify such challenges through an evolutionary view from the early years of SOA to microservices, and beyond. Our findings are backed by a literature review, comprising both academic and gray literature. Afterwards, we analyze how such challenges are addressed in practice, and which challenges remain open, by inspecting microservice-related projects on GitHub, the largest open-source repository to date.",

		"abstract": "IoT edge computing is a new computing paradigm “in the IoT domain” for performing calculations and processing at the edge of the network, closer to the user and the source of the data. This paradigm is relatively recent, and, together with cloud and fog computing, there may be some confusion about its meaning and implications. This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers better understand what the industry thinks about what IoT edge computing is, and the expected benefits and challenges associated with this paradigm. We conducted a survey using a semi-structured in-depth questionnaire to collect qualitative data from relevant stakeholders from 29 multinational companies and qualitatively analyzed these data using the Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz) method. Several researchers participated in the coding process (collaborative coding). To ensure consensus on the constructs that support the theory and thus improve the rigor of qualitative research, we conducted an intercoder agreement analysis. From the analysis, we have derived a substantive and analytic theory of what companies perceive about IoT edge computing, its benefits and challenges. The theory is substantive in that the scope of validity refers to the 29 surveys processed and analytic in that it analyzes “what is” rather than explaining causality or attempting predictive generalizations. A public repository with all the data related to the information capture process and the products resulting from the analysis of this information is publicly available. This study aims to strengthen the evidence and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about why companies are adopting edge computing and the current challenges they face. Additionally, the testing theory phase shows that the results are aligned with the ISO/IEC TR 30164 standard.",

		"abstract": "Over the past few years, the relevance of the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown significantly and is now a key component of many industrial processes and even a transparent participant in various activities performed in our daily life. IoT systems are subjected to changes in the dynamic environments they operate in. These changes (e.g. variations in bandwidth consumption or new devices joining/leaving) may impact the Quality of Service (QoS) of the IoT system. A number of self-adaptation strategies for IoT architectures to better deal with these changes have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, they focus on isolated types of changes. We lack a comprehensive view of the trade-offs of each proposal and how they could be combined to cope with simultaneous events of different types.In this paper, we identify, analyze, and interpret relevant studies related to IoT adaptation and develop a comprehensive and holistic view of the interplay of different dynamic events, their consequences on QoS, and the alternatives for the adaptation. To do so, we have conducted a systematic literature review of existing scientific proposals and defined a research agenda for the near future based on the findings and weaknesses identified in the literature.",

		"abstract": "Edge-to-cloud continuum connects and extends the calculation from edge side via network to cloud platforms, where diverse workflows go back and forth, getting executed on scheduled calculation resources. To better utilize the calculation resources from all sides, workflow offloading problems have been investigating lately. Most works focus on optimizing constraints like: latency requirements, resource utilization rate limits, and energy consumption bounds. However, the dynamics among the offloading environment have hardly been researched, which easily results in uncertain Quality of Service(QoS) on the user side. Any part of the workload change, resource availability change or network latency could incur dynamics in an offloading environment. In this work, we propose a robust PAC (probably approximately correct) offloading algorithm to address this dynamic issue together with optimization. We train an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence neural network to learn how to offload workflows in edge-to-cloud continuum. Comprehensive implementations and corresponding comparison against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the robustness of our proposed algorithm. More specifically, our algorithm achieves better offloading performance regarding dynamic heterogeneous offloading environment and faster adaptation to newly changed environments than fine-tuned state-of-the-art RL-based offloading methods.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, the majority of Internet traffic is multimedia content. Video streaming services are in high demand by end users and use HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) as transmission protocol. HAS splits the video into non-overlapping chunks and each video chunk can be encoded independently using different representations. Therefore, these encode tasks can be parallelized and Cloud computing can be used for this. However, in the most extended solutions, the infrastructure must be configured and provisioned in advance. Recently, serverless platforms have made posible to deploy functions that can scale from zero to a configurable maximum. This work presents and analyses the behavior of event-driven serverless functions to encode video chunks and to compute, optionally, the quality of the encoded videos. These functions have been implemented using an adapted version of embedded Tomcat to deal with CloudEvents. We have deployed these event-driven serverless pipelines for video coding and quality metrics on an on-premises serverless platform based on Knative on one master node and eight worker nodes. We have tested the scalability and resource consumption of the proposed solution using two video codecs: x264 and AV1, varying the maximum number of replicas and the resources allocated to them (fat and slim function replicas). We have encoded different 4K videos to generate multiple representations per function call and we show how it is possible to create pipelines of serverless media functions. The results of the different tests carried out show the good performance of the serverless functions proposed. The system scales the replicas and distributes the jobs evenly across all the replicas. The overall encoding time is reduced by 18% using slim replicas but fat replicas are more adequate in live video streaming as the encoding time per chunk is reduced. Finally, the results of the pipeline test show an appropriate distribution and chaining among the available replicas of each function type.",

The latency and other challenges of cloud-centric IoT, driven edge computing-based data processing architectures. In precise, IoT data analytics requires control for dealing with the complete life cycle of data flow between data sources to sinks by building a set of data pipelines seamlessly deployed on the IoT computing continuum (Edge and Clouds). The execution of data analytic tasks is challenging in the IoT computing continuum due to heterogeneous hardware architecture at edge and cloud environments. This can be succeeded using Serverless or Function as a Service (FaaS) cloud computing model, wherein tasks are defined as virtual functions and seamlessly migrated and executed within the computing continuum. The serverless data pipelines constitutes a data source, a set of serverless functions that performs specific operations on the data and then ultimately a data sink. Similarly, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Providers have typical edge and cloud solutions for IoT data processing that includes the serverless entities as a part of the system. However, cost and latency vary according to cloud provider subscriptions and architecture components. So our proposed work outlines the cloud service provider-specific IoT services that are composed in designing the serverless data pipelines (SDP) for IoT data processing. Further, we investigate their performance in terms of latency, cost and cold/warm start time of serverless functions for IoT data oriented pipelines. Aligning to this, we propose AWS and Microsoft Azure based SDP architectures for predictive analytics in Industrial IoT environments and implement the real time Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Motor application. Accordingly, we measure the efficiency of AWS and Azure SDP architecture for various performance metrics such as cost, processing time and cold/warm start time for serverless invocations.",

Nowadays, Kubernetes is a leading open-source container orchestration platform that has become the de facto standard. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Kubernetes orchestrator and grasp the current research emphasis by using a bibliometric analysis. Bibliometrix software was adopted as bibliometric analysis tools to find hot research topics and guide the future researching in the area. The Web of Science core collection database was used as the primary source for data collection. Data were collected from 803 articles published from 2014 to September 2022. In particular, publication outputs and research areas can provide insight into the development trends and current domains in terms of Kubernetes research. The most influential and productive authors, institutions, countries and journals contributed to this bibliometric analysis. The hottest research topics on Kubernetes are mainly centered on “cloud/fog/edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT)”, “containers and virtualization”, “docker”, “resource scheduling”, “microservices” and “artificial intelligent (AI)”. A cluster analysis was conducted from a keyword perspective to obtain emerging trends and frontiers for Kubernetes. The results showed that future research should focus on “automation”, “5G”, “scalability”, “resource scheduling”, “serverless”, “service mesh” and “blockchain”. Therefore, this paper aims to assist academics and practitioners in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the status quo and trends in Kubernetes research.",

		"abstract": "Cloud service providers can operate several execution instances on a single physical server using virtualization technology, which improves resource utilization. In recent years, container-based virtualization has been developed as a remarkably lightweight alternative to virtual machines. Containers consume less memory than virtual machines, enabling faster setup and portability. Cloud-based applications require dynamic resource allocation in response to fluctuations in the number of incoming requests. Most articles on proactive autoscaling in cloud computing have shortcomings in two ways. 1) During feature extraction, the temporal patterns of the data are ignored, and the historical sequences are assigned equal weight. 2) Existing research omits cool down time (CDT) from the planning phase. 3) Scaling operations can be performed at any time depending only on the current input workload, resulting in a large number of contradicting scaling actions. In response to the above shortcomings, this paper presents a proactive autoscaling method for web applications in Kubernetes using an attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) encoder-decoder (K-AGRUED), which predicts the resource usage of several future steps based on CDT. The results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces prediction error by 2–25% compared to state of the art methods. Our approach significantly reduces scaling operations and under-provisioning compared to the standard horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) of Kubernetes and two previous studies. The K-AGRUED increases the scaling speedup by a factor of up to five in a real environment.",

		"abstract": "Deep learning has been postulated as a solution for numerous problems in different branches of science. Given the resource-intensive nature of these models, they often need to be executed on specialized hardware such graphical processing units (GPUs) in a distributed manner. In the academic field, researchers get access to this kind of resources through High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. This kind of infrastructures make the training of these models difficult due to their multi-user nature and limited user permission. In addition, different HPC clusters may possess different peculiarities that can entangle the research cycle (e.g., libraries dependencies). In this paper we develop a workflow and methodology for the distributed training of deep learning models in HPC clusters which provides researchers with a series of novel advantages. It relies on udocker as containerization tool and on Horovod as library for the distribution of the models across multiple GPUs. udocker does not need any special permission, allowing researchers to run the entire workflow without relying on any administrator. Horovod ensures the efficient distribution of the training independently of the deep learning framework used. Additionally, due to containerization and specific features of the workflow, it provides researchers with a cluster-agnostic way of running their models. The experiments carried out show that the workflow offers good scalability in the distributed training of the models and that it easily adapts to different clusters.",

		"abstract": "With the increasing computing and networking capabilities, IoT devices and edge gateways have become part of a larger IoT–edge–cloud computing continuum, where processing and storage tasks are distributed across the whole network hierarchy, not concentrated only in the cloud. At the same time, this also introduced continuous delivery practices to the development of software components for network-connected gateways and sensing/actuating nodes. These devices are placed on end users’ premises and are characterized by continuously changing cyber-physical contexts, forcing software developers to maintain multiple application versions and frequently redeploy them on a distributed fleet of devices with respect to their current contexts. Doing this correctly and efficiently goes beyond manual capabilities and requires an intelligent and reliable automated solution. This paper describes a model-based approach to automatically assigning multiple software deployment plans to hundreds of edge gateways and connected IoT devices implemented in collaboration with a smart healthcare application provider. From a platform-specific model of an existing edge computing platform, we extract a platform-independent model that describes a list of target devices and a pool of available deployment plans. Next, we use constraint solving to automatically assign deployment plans to devices at once with respect to their specific contexts. The result is transformed back into the platform-specific model and includes a suitable deployment plan for each device, which is then consumed by our engine to deploy software components not only on edge gateways but also on their downstream IoT devices with constrained resources and connectivity. We validate the approach with a fleet deployment prototype integrated into a DevOps toolchain used by the partner application provider. Initial experiments demonstrate the viability of the approach and its usefulness in supporting DevOps for edge and IoT software development.",

		"abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) aims to make an environment more innovative and productive by connecting physical things to the internet. Processing generated data from IoT devices and actuation warranted in real-time requires computational infrastructure near the edge to get the outcome without delay. Emerging edge technologies such as Fog computing, Multi-Access Edge Computing, and Cloudlet provide computing resources near the edge, i.e. closer to the IoT devices, where devices can place their services/applications or offload their computational job for processing. The utilization of computing resources provided by emerging edge technologies addresses the issue of delay in the outcome and increases the battery life of IoT devices/End-user devices. Computational resources provided by the edge technologies, i.e. edge/fog nodes, can be heterogeneous, dynamic and mobile. Therefore, service placement and computation offloading on edge/fog nodes are challenging issues, and the problem to finding the best suitable fog/edge nodes is NP-Hard. Nature-inspired algorithms provide robust solutions to NP-Hard problems. Nowadays, nature-inspired algorithms have been widely applied for resource allocation for service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge technologies. In this work, we provide a detailed study on the applications of nature-inspired algorithms in emerging edge computing domains. We provide an overview of emerging edge technologies, related quality parameters and nature-inspired algorithms followed by the basic formulation of service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge computing systems. In this work, we classify the works in emerging edge computing applying nature-inspired algorithms into two categories: works related to service placement and works related to offloading. We provide a thorough review and comparison of the existing nature-inspired approaches in each category. We discuss various open issues at the end to set future research directions.",

		"abstract": "With the development of mobile network and the continuous improvement of network speed, the pressure of network traffic is becoming more and more prominent. In this context, the design of the fifth generation (5G) communication networks has become one of the key issues considered by operators. This paper studies a new open wireless access network architecture based on Software Defined Network (SDN) and Reservoir Computing (RC). On this basis, a scheme of air interface control and data separation in mobile communication network is designed. Firstly, through the advantage of the SDN, storage analysis of the energy cost of the underlying network equipment, the cost of virtual network resources and the average load of CPU are unified managed. Secondly, an adequate adaptive reservoir pool Echo State Network (ARP-ESN) model is proposed to enhance users’ traffic predicting. With the combination of global view resource state and precisely traffic predicting, the dynamic configuration of network resources under the specific business function chain is realized, so as to improve the utilization of the whole basic network resources. The simulation verifies the reliability and effectiveness of the algorithm. It can realize the rapid deployment of 5G mobile communication network and the flexible management and control of virtual network functional units, so as to improve the overall utilization of network resources.",

		"abstract": "Achieving sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction and resource utilization are always a bottleneck for resource providers, especially when trying to meet the computing needs of resource hungry applications in mobile edge-cloud (MEC) continuum. Recent research uses metaheuristic techniques to allocate resources to large-scale applications in MECs. However, some challenges attributed to the metaheuristic techniques include entrapment at the local optima caused by premature convergence and imbalance between the local and global searches. These may affect resource allocation in MECs if continually implemented. To address these concerns and ensure efficient resource allocation in MECs, we propose a fruit fly-based simulated annealing optimization scheme (FSAOS) to serve as a potential solution. In the proposed scheme, the simulated annealing is incorporated to balance between the global and local search and to overcome its premature convergence. We also introduce a trade-off factor to allow application owners to select the best service quality that will minimize their execution cost. Implementation of the FSAOS is carried out on EdgeCloudSim Simulator tool. Simulation results show that the FSAOS can schedule resources effectively based on tasks requirement by returning minimum makespan and execution costs, and achieve better resource utilization compared to the conventional fruit fly optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization. To further unveil how efficient the FSAOSs, a statistical analysis based on 95% confidential interval is carried out. Numerical results show that FSAOS outperforms the benchmark schemes by achieving higher confidence level. This is an indication that the proposed FSAOS can provide efficient resource allocation in MECs while meeting customers’ aspirations as well as that of the resource providers.",

		"abstract": "Autonomous driving is a key technology for intelligent logistics in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In autonomous driving, the appearance of incomplete point clouds that lose geometric and semantic information is inevitable due to the limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The existence of incomplete point clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to a reduction in the accuracy of object detection, traffic alerts, and collision avoidance for autonomous driving vehicles. Existing point cloud completion networks, such as the Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of point cloud completion without considering the efficiency of the inference process, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point cloud repair in autonomous driving. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving accurately and efficiently. In the proposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm that combines incremental sampling and one-time sampling is presented to improve the inference speed of the PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and autonomous driving scenes are created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5 different sizes are used for three autonomous driving situations. The improved PF-Net can achieve speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when compared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving.",

		"abstract": "Modern information systems are built fron a complex composition of networks, infrastructure, devices, services, and applications, interconnected by data flows that are often private and financially sensitive. The 5G networks, which can create hyperlocalized services, have highlighted many of the deficiencies of current practices in use today to create and operate information systems. Emerging cloud computing techniques, such as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and elastic computing, offer a path for a future re-imagining of how we create, deploy, secure, operate, and retire information systems. In this paper, we articulate the position that a comprehensive new approach is needed for all OSI layers from layer 2 up to applications that are built on underlying principles that include reproducibility, continuous integration/continuous delivery, auditability, and versioning. There are obvious needs to redesign and optimize the protocols from the network layer to the application layer. Our vision seeks to augment existing Cloud Computing and Networking solutions with support for multiple cloud infrastructures and seamless integration of cloud-based microservices. To address these issues, we propose an approach named Open Infrastructure as Code (OpenIaC), which is an attempt to provide a common open forum to integrate and build on advances in cloud computing and blockchain to address the needs of modern information architectures. The main mission of our OpenIaC approach is to provide services based on the principles of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) among the federation of connected resources based on Decentralized Identity (DID). Our objectives include the creation of an open-source hub with fine-grained access control for an open and connected infrastructure of shared resources (sensing, storage, computing, 3D printing, etc.) managed by blockchains and federations. Our proposed approach has the potential to provide a path for developing new platforms, business models, and a modernized information ecosystem necessary for 5G networks.",

These IIoT devices generate a massive amount of data called big data. Using fog computing architecture for processing this extensive data will reduce the service time and the service cost for the IIoT applications. The primary challenge is to design better service placement strategies to deploy the IIoT service requests on the fog nodes to minimize service costs and ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of IIoT applications. Hence, the placement of IIoT services on the fog nodes can be considered as NP-hard problem. In this work, the meta-heuristic-based hybrid algorithms, namely: MGAPSO and EGAPSO, are developed by combining the GA & PSO and Elitism-based GA (EGA) & PSO, respectively. Further, carried out experiments on the two-level fog computing framework developed using docker and containers on 1.4 GHz, 64-bit quad-core processor devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid EGAPSO algorithm minimizes service time, service cost, and energy consumption and ensures the IIoT applications’ QoS compared to other proposed and state-of-the-art service placement strategies considered for the performance evaluation.",

As the number of Internet-connected devices exponentially increases, the effectiveness of cloud computing is reaching its limits in terms of scalability and accessibility. The concept of edge computing allows the overload of the cloud to be reduced and provides remarkable advantages for Internet of Things systems. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a knowledge-based edge computing framework for enabling heterogeneous connectivity in Internet of Things networks.

		"abstract": "Our world is being transformed by connectivity and technology as time goes by, which requires continuous improvement of quality of service (QoS) levels in the systems. Currently, many emerging technologies demand latency-aware networks for real-time data processing, and we are becoming more dependent on those technologies day by day. Cloud computing environments provide high availability, reliability, and performance; however, cloud computing may not be suitable for latency-sensitive applications, such as disaster risk minimization, intelligent traffic management, and crime prevention, for instance. Two complementary paradigms, namely edge and fog computing, have been proposed to overcome the latency issues and increase the computing power between the cloud and edge devices (e.g., controllers, sensors, and smartphones). However, evaluating availability aspects is still a significant concern in those distributed computing environments since many challenges must be faced to guarantee the required QoS for those systems. Therefore, this study addresses the edge-fog-cloud continuum’s availability, where we propose a hierarchical availability model using fault tree and Markov chains. Also, we propose analytical availability models for the components in our environment, which may be used to support scalability and capacity planning of edge, fog, and cloud computing environments. Using our proposed hierarchical model, we investigated several scenarios to improve the system’s availability. In one of the case studies, we could investigate how to improve the availability of a baseline intelligent traffic management infrastructure, which was 98.47%, and we improved to 99.91%.",

		"abstract": "The management of IoT solutions is a complex task due to their inherent distribution and heterogeneity. IoT management approaches focus on devices and connectivity, thus lacking a comprehensive understanding of the different software, hardware, and communication components that comprise an IoT-based solution. This paper proposes a novel four-layer IoT Management Architecture (IoTManA) that encompasses various aspects of a distributed infrastructure for managing, controlling, and monitoring software, hardware, and communication components, as well as dataflows and data quality. Our architecture provides a cross-layer graph-based view of the end-to-end path between devices and the cloud. IoTManA has been implemented in a set of software components named IoT management system (IoTManS) and tested in two scenarios—Smart Agriculture and Smart Cities—showing that it can significantly contribute to harnessing the complexity of managing IoT solutions. The cross-layer graph-based modeling of IoTManA facilitates the implemented management system (IoTManS) to detect and identify root causes of typically distributed failures occurring in IoT solutions. We conducted a performance analysis of IoTManS focusing on two aspects—failure detection time and scalability—to demonstrate application scenarios and capabilities. The results show that IoTManS can detect and identify the root cause of failures in 806ms to 90,036ms depending on its operation mode, adapting to different IoT needs. Also, the IoTManS scalability is directly proportional to the scalability of the underlying IoT Platform, managing up to 5,000 components simultaneously.",

The new generation of smart systems requires processing a vast amount of diverse information from distributed data sources. The software architecture presented in this chapter addresses two main challenges. On the one hand, a new elasticity concept enables smart systems to satisfy the performance requirements of extreme-scale analytics workloads. By extending the elasticity concept (known at cloud side) across the compute continuum in a fog computing environment, combined with the usage of advanced heterogeneous hardware architectures at the edge side, the capabilities of the extreme-scale analytics can significantly increase, integrating both responsive data-in-motion and latent data-at-rest analytics into a single solution. On the other hand, the software architecture also focuses on the fulfilment of the non-functional properties inherited from smart systems, such as real-time, energy-efficiency, communication quality and security, that are of paramount importance for many application domains such as smart cities, smart mobility and smart manufacturing.",

However it is not yet ready to be adopted on node clusters distributed in the Cloud-to-Edge continuum. In particular its scheduling strategy is not suitable for the placement of modern latency-sensitive applications on Edge environments, characterized by frequent node failures and network partitions. In this work we propose a network-aware scheduling extension of the default Kubernetes scheduler that takes into account the ever changing infrastructure network conditions and the dynamic communication interactions between microservices, with the aim to optimize the placement of application containers.",

		"abstract": "The concept of Edge-to-Cloud Continuum aims to significantly reduce overall traffic to the cloud by enabling IoT data processing as close as possible to the data sources, either on near- or far-edge devices. In this highly dynamic environment, where IoT devices and edge nodes are constantly changing their state and location, services running on edge nodes have to be scheduled, deployed and managed to ensure high service availability with appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. However, once services are deployed in the edge-to-cloud continuum, the question arises how to ensure continuous data delivery from IoT devices to the appropriate services for further processing, either on edge devices or in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a general architecture for adaptive data-driven routing in the edge-to-cloud continuum and introduce an implementation of this architecture using the content-based publish/subscribe approach. We evaluate the given implementation against a real-world use case scenario for federated learning in an edge-to-cloud environment hosting digital twins. The performance evaluation of this scenario shows that our implementation efficiently adapts to service failures and reconfigures the edge-to-cloud environment with minimal latency and without data loss, while preserving data privacy and security. In addition, the experiments show that our solution is stable in an environment with IoT data sources generating data at high frequency.",

This use-case requires both real-time data processing ( data in motion ) for driving assistance and online city-wide monitoring, as well as large-scale offline processing of big data sets collected from sensors ( data at rest ). As such, it demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the CLASS software architecture to coordinate edge and cloud for big data analytics. Concretely, the CLASS smart city use case includes a range of mobility-related applications, including extended car awareness for collision avoidance, air pollution monitoring, and digital traffic sign management.

		"abstract": "The efficient exploitation of the cloud continuum (interworking of industrial cloud, edge cloud, 5G/B5G base stations, and fog node technologies) is a key factor for future Industry4.0 and beyond applications. For instance, with their ability to work more locally to data sources and to controllable actuators, cloud continuum-based solutions are considered very promising for dynamic manufacturing line control/reconfiguration and for sustainability optimizations (reduction of power and materials consumption). In these contexts, privacy, data sovereignty/control, latency, reliability, and scalability are crucial. This short paper, summarizing some key concepts from the associated keynote speech, aims at offering an overview of the concept of Digital Twins (DTs) for Industry5.0 [ 1 ] and at showing some primary and state-of-the-art solution guidelines that are emerging in the field. In particular, in our H2020 IoTwins project [ 2 ], we promote, design, implement, and evaluate Industry5.0 DTs that are both distributed because they are able to run over differentiated cloud continuum virtualized resources, also by changing their location dynamically, and hybrid because they combine data-driven machine learning models and simulations based on mathematical-physical modeling of the cyber-physical systems they represent. Distributed and hybrid DTs based on cloud continuum technologies are showing their effectiveness and efficiency in different application cases and scenarios, as demonstrated by our experience of IoTwins testbeds development.",

Obviously, while highlighting the robustness of the public cloud, the pandemic-induced situation also highlights several important research challenges that need to be addressed. This paper presents a multi-source based analysis for the identification of cloud computing research challenges as part of the road mapping methodology followed in the HUB4CLOUD project. The analysis consists of an in-depth study of several sources including analysis of the international context, analysis of academic venues, interviews with relevant stakeholders and existing funded projects.

		"abstract": "Microservices architecture has an essential characteristic of loose coupling compared to traditional monolithic applications, allowing applications to be created, updated, and extended independently. With lightweight virtualization technologies, such as container, microservices-based applications can be widely deployed to the edge of the network. However, challenges of deploying microservice in edge come from the contradiction between the latency sensitivity of applications and limited node resources. We propose a microservice orchestration model(SCORE) for edge scenarios that enable microservice scheduling based on spectrum clustering(MSSC) and dynamic resource allocation under multi-dimension constraints based on the sliding window(SW) mechanism. MSSC significantly reduces the cross-node communication traffic between microservices by portraying the dependencies between microservices through a graph and then using spectral clustering to map microservices to edge nodes. At the same time, the process of cluster scaling under multi-dimension provides more fine-grained resource allocation for microservices and improves resource utilization while ensuring service-level performance objectives(SLOs). The experimental results indicate that our approach reduces the inter-node communication traffic by 17.7% compared to baseline, and the overall average memory requested for processing a single request is 19.4% and 45.8% of baseline, respectively.",

		"abstract": "The explosion of digital financial services during the last part of the 2010s in emerging markets needs a framework to confirm the customer identity for personalized service and to robust the compliance processes, especially, prevention of financial fraud and money laundering because sales of financial products and services use more frequently digital channels. Financial institutions need to deploy artificial intelligence technologies to evolve for the next step of this growing digital business, and they require a transformation of process and methods where models based on deep learning could be a tool to implement to prevent financial crime. However, those processes use large computational resources that require edge–cloud computing because to implement facial recognition, financial institutions need to connect IoT and mobile devices. Thus, this chapter aims to explore a mechanism for deep learning-based facial recognition to improve customer identification in financial institutions on a hybrid architecture. We propose a model that integrates traditional classifiers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to facial recognition involving visual sequences or different image sources as social media as a tool for financial institutions. In this chapter, we propose a hybrid architecture between the edge and cloud computing, which catalyzes the use of these face detection tools in personalized services. Our results show that the traditional models and deep learning integration achieve optimization of searching processes and facial recognition, but some methods work better than others, possibly by features of datasets and architecture infrastructure. In this case, we integrated machine learning architectures that facilitate the management of the facial recognition process to financial institutions and achieve better computational efficiency. We conclude that the combination of deep learning tools and face recognition systems not only needs tuning and training CNN parameters to enhance the tool’s accuracy and evolution, but also those tools require an architecture that optimizes its performance.",

		"abstract": "The advent of AI/ML in B5G and Multi-Access Edge Computing will rely on the acceleration of neural networks. The current work focuses on the acceleration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) kernels playing a key role in numerous applications. We assume various LSTM sizes while targeting FPGA and GPU hardware for both embedded and server MEC purposes. Systematically, we perform a design space exploration to determine the most efficient acceleration approach and most suitable configuration for each device. We use High-Level-Synthesis to implement our proposed circuit architectures on Xilinx FPGAs, while we use high level tools for NVIDIA GPUs such as PyTorch’s JIT compiler or ONNX runtime. Our exploration shows that the full parallelization of an LSTM array multiplication quickly overutilizes the FPGA, while on GPUs LSTM models can be deployed more easily. Instead, the best approach for FPGAs is to find a balance between parallelizing LSTM gates and vector multiplications. Our comparative study shows that FPGAs prevail in light LSTM models, whereas GPUs prevail in larger model topologies. Moreover, we show that far- and near-edge FPGAs achieve similar latency, however, near-edge GPUs can achieve one order of magnitude faster execution than far-edge GPUs. The best results range in 0.3–5 ms latency per execution with acceleration factors in 12 $\\times × –174 \\times $ × .",

		"abstract": "The concept of digital twins has emerged from the smart manufacturing space and is now gaining adoption in many other industries beyond manufacturing. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a cyber-physical system that is used to capture the state of the system and to allow reason and decision-making on that state. While there has been much research on this topic, there is less work on the overall lifecycle ecosystem that supports the smooth interoperation of a physical facility (like a machine, a factory or even a supply chain) and its digital components (like data, processes and digital twins), which is called the Digital Thread. The aim of the Digital Thread is the creation of a digital lifecycle ecosystem that links together the data generated throughout a product’s lifecycle and represents the data, processes and communication platform that supports a product and its production at any instance of time.",

In this paper, we propose to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve the Task Assignment Problem (TAP) at the edge layer and then we propose a novel multi-layer extension of RL (ML-RL) techniques that allows edge agents to query an upper-level agent with more knowledge to improve the performance in complex and uncertain situations. We first formulate the task assignment process considering the trade-off between energy consumption and execution time. We then present a greedy solution as a baseline and implement our two RL proposals in the PureEdgeSim simulator. Finally, several simulations of each algorithm are evaluated with different numbers of devices to verify scalability. The simulation results show that reinforcement learning solutions outperformed the heuristic-based solutions and our multi-layer approach can significantly improve performance in high device density scenarios.",

		"abstract": "The vast benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) stem from the big data collected by the IoT devices. Currently, majority of this data is transferred to cloud-based servers where it is processed and analyzed for further actions. However, the transfer of the IoT big data to the cloud utilizes high network bandwidth and may also result in unacceptable response time for time-critical applications. The advent of fog computing has provided a direction for addressing these constraints of bandwidth and latency. IoT data related to time-critical applications can be stored at the fog nodes for faster processing. However, this data is generally high dimensional apart from being large sized and thus needs to be efficiently stored for scalability of related applications. Fragmentation of data has been established as a suitable technique for scaling of big data storage. This work presents an enhanced version of the existing Bond Energy Algorithm for vertical fragmentation of IoT data to be stored and processed on fog nodes. The proposed algorithm considers the criticality, access frequency and latency requirements of applications to determine how data may be fragmented across the fog nodes. The results of the algorithm show a marked improvement in performance as compared to the scenario where data is not fragmented. The findings are applicable to both relational and non-relational databases.",

We adopt the Network-Slicing Management and Orchestration (NS-MANO) approach, a set of building blocks that integrates the NECOS platform to fill the gap caused by a lack of multi-domain Network-Slicing capability support. The NS-MANO harnesses Softwarization and Cloudification facilities to automatically provision elastic Network-Slice parts that span across the backhauling, fronthauling, and Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructures of federated multi-domains. Additionally, NS-MANO binds all Network-Slice parts together into NECOS previously-orchestrated Cloud-Network Slice parts that form a full end-to-end Cloud-Network Slice instance. We designed a prototype atop a real-world testbed to check the NECOS/NS-MANO holistic architecture conformance, functional effectiveness, and performance impact. The findings suggest that the prototype offers an effective means of laying the foundations for an end-to-end Cloud-Network Slice lifecycle while keeping mobile users perceiving affordable quality over time. Additionally, we estimate the prototype cost through quantitative analysis on response times and signaling overhead along the experiment time.",

The paper illustrates how MiCADO-Edge can automatically deploy complex sets of interconnected microservices in such multi-layered cloud-to-edge environments. Additionally, it shows how monitoring information can be collected from such services and how complex, user- defined run-time management policies can be enforced on application components running at any layer of the architecture.

		"abstract": "Software-defined networking decouples control and data plane in softwarized networks. This allows for centralized management of the network, but complete centralization of the controller functions raises potential issues related to failure, latency, and scalability. Distributed controller deployment is adopted to optimize scalability and latency problems. However, existing controllers are monolithic, resulting in code inefficiency for distributed deployment. Some seminal ongoing efforts have been proposed with the idea of disaggregating the SDN controller architecture into an assembly of various subsystems, each of which can be responsible for a certain controller task. These subsystems are typically implemented as microservices and deployed as virtual network functions, in particular as Docker Containers. This enables flexible deployment of controller functions. However, these proposals (e.g., μ μ ONOS) are still in their early stage of design and development, so that a full decomposition of the SDN controller is not been available yet. To fill that gap, this article derives some important design guidelines to decompose an SDN controller into a set of microservices. Next, it also proposes a microservices-based decomposed controller architecture, foreseeing communications issues between the controller sub-functions. These design and performance considerations are also proven via the implementation of the proposed architecture as a solution, called Micro-Services based SDN controller (MSN), based on the Ryu SDN controller. Moreover, MSN includes different network communication protocols, such as gRPC, WebSocket, and REST-API. Finally, we show experimental results that highlight the robustness and latency of the system on a networking testbed. Collected results prove the main pros and cons of each network communication protocol and an evaluation of our proposal in terms of system resilience, scalability and latency.",

The bulk of data generated by the digital devices is challenging to handle, resulting in latency issues while provisioning services to the end-users. To address this issue, a promising solution is provided by osmotic computing, which exploits as well as integrates cloud, edge, and Internet of things platforms. Osmotic computing is a growing research domain that has laid the foundation of a new state-of-the-art computing paradigm by objectifying the scenarios for handling hefty data and computations according to user’s requirement and resource availability. However, the eclectic range of computational resources and services available between datacenters of different platforms in the federated environment is a tedious task to manage. In this paper, we propose a task mapping algorithm by incorporating osmotic computing principles to complete the tasks in latency-sensitive systems. We present an osmotic task manager, which aims to optimize the mapping decisions for all the services based on two-fold categorization, namely task-level categorization and processing-level categorization. The objective is to categorize all the incoming requests on the basis of their resource requirement and efficient mapping of the tasks to resources. The proposed algorithm is simulated and evaluated using various synthetic test cases to show its efficacy.",

		"abstract": "Cloud Computing has been successful in providing substantial amounts of resources to deploy scalable and highly available applications. However, there is a growing necessity of lower latency services and cheap bandwidth access to accommodate the expansion of IoT and other applications that reside at the internet’s edge. The development of community networks and volunteer computing, together with the today’s low cost of compute and storage devices, is making the internet’s edge filled with a large amount of still underutilized resources. Due to this, new computing paradigms like Edge Computing and Fog Computing are emerging. This work presents Caravela a Docker’s container orchestrator that utilizes volunteer edge resources from users to build an Edge Cloud where it is possible to deploy applications using standard Docker containers. Current cloud solutions are mostly tied to a centralized cluster environment deployment. Caravela employs a completely decentralized architecture, resource discovery and scheduling algorithms to cope with (1) the large amount of volunteer devices, volatile environment, (2) wide area networks that connects the devices and (3) nonexistent natural central administration.",

		"abstract": "Fog computing provides a distributed computing paradigm that executes interactive and distributed applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Large-scale scientific applications, often in the form of workflow ensembles, have a distributed and interactive nature that demands a dispersed execution environment like fog computing. However, handling a large-scale application in heterogeneous environment of fog computing requires harmonizing heterologous resources over the continuum from the IoT to the cloud. This paper investigates offloading and task allocation problems for orchestrating the resources in a fog computing environment where the IoT application is considered in the form of workflow ensembles. We called Offload-Location a mechanism which has been designed to find offloading coalition structure alongside a matching algorithm for allocating the offloaded tasks to fog/cloud resources. The introduced solution attempts to minimize the execution time and minimize the price paid to servers for executing the tasks provided that Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the ensemble’s deadline and budget are retaining. These objectives lead to maximizing the number of completed workflows of the ensemble as an ultimate goal. The appropriate performance of this mechanism is studied under different workflow applications and circumstances.",

		"abstract": "Edge microservice applications are becoming a viable solution for the execution of real-time IoT analytics, due to their rapid response and reduced latency. With Edge Computing, unlike the central Cloud, the amount of available resource is constrained and the computation that can be undertaken is also limited. Microservices are not standalone, they are devised as a set of cooperating tasks that are fed data over the network through specific APIs. The cost of processing these feeds of data in real-time, especially for massive IoT configurations, is however generally overlooked. In this work we evaluate the cost of dealing with thousands of sensors sending data to the edge with the commonly used encoding of JSON over REST interfaces, and compare this to other mechanisms that use binary encodings as well as streaming interfaces. The choice has a big impact on the microservice implementation, as a wrong selection can lead to excessive resource consumption, because using a less efficient encoding and transport mechanism results in much higher resource requirements, even to do an identical job.",

		"abstract": "This paper introduces an open-source platform to support serverless computing for scientific data-processing workflow-based applications across the Cloud continuum (i.e. simultaneously involving both on-premises and public Cloud platforms to process data captured at the edge). This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.",

		"abstract": "Osmotic Computing represents a glue solution able to manage the deployment and orchestration of interconnected microelements across heterogeneous physical and virtual infrastructures (e.g., IoT, Edge and Cloud nodes) according to the behavior of hardware and software components during the time. The adoption of Osmotic Computing is challenging, but addressing networking issues is a key research topic due to the emergence of new problems in terms of QoS requirements. In this paper, we analyze how to exploit well-known networking solutions, such as the Dijkstra’s algorithm, and Big Data oriented technologies, such as the Hadoop and MapReduce, to provide efficient newtorking functionalities in Osmotic Computing. In particular, our objective is to minimize the routing path computation time in the software defined network (SDN) at the basis of microelement networking, as well as to ensure a global view and a high level of dynamism of our network topology. To accomplish this task, we process routing tables through a MapReduce based implementation of the Dijkstra’s algorithm whenever a topology change occurs, and we export routing results into the SDN. Our experimental results show that our networking strategy drastically reduces the best path computation time whenever the network of microelements is very large.",

The scalability feature of cloud computing gives the facility to application providers to dynamically provision the computing power and storage capacity from cloud data centers. The consolidation of services to few active servers can enhance the service sustainability and reduce the operational cost. The state-of-art algorithms mostly focus either on reactive or proactive auto-scaling techniques. In this article, a Robust Hybrid Auto-Scaler (RHAS) is presented for web applications. The time series forecasting model has been used to predict the future incoming workload. The reactive approach is used to deal with the current resource requirement. The proposed auto-scaling technique is designed with the threshold-based rules and queuing model. The security mechanism is used to secure the user’s request and response to the web-applications deployed in cloud environment. The designed approach has been tested with two real-time web application workloads of ClarkNet and NASA. The proposed technique achieves $14%$ 14 % reduction in cost, and significant improvement in response time, service level agreement (SLA) violation, and gives consistency in CPU utilization.",

This problem can be generalised to missing knowledge about the extent of any hardware-bound instructions within the images that may require elevated privileges. We first conduct a systematic one-year evolution analysis of a sample of Docker images concerning their use of hardware-specific features. To improve the state of technology, we contribute novel tools to manage such images.

Resources, including compute and storage, are increasingly located at the edge of the network and bridge the gap between the cloud and IoT entities. Edge computing enables low-latency, privacy-awareness, and resilient applications. Many of the applications are in fact business process-based and are distributed over edge as well as cloud resources. Edge devices can be used to analyze high-volume IoT data streams for on-premises monitoring and alerting, and at the same time to aggregate and forward these data to other premises or the cloud for long-term storage and analytics. Many operational and business challenges can be solved by running applications on edge resources or on-premises of Edge-Cloud infrastructure. However, the broad range of IoT application requirements concerning latency, QoS, or fault-tolerance, combined with the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of edge networks, make it particularly challenging to develop, configure, deploy, and operate such applications.

Various SP stacks exist today, with applications ranging from IoT analytics to processing of payment transactions. The backbone of said stacks are Stream Processing Engines (SPEs), software packages offering a high-level programming model and scalable execution of data stream processing pipelines. SPEs have been traditionally developed to work inside a single datacenter, and optimised for speed. With the advent of Fog computing, however, the processing of data streams needs to be carried out over multiple geographically distributed computing sites: Data gets typically pre-processed close to where they are generated, then aggregated at intermediate nodes, and finally globally and persistently stored in the Cloud. SPEs were not designed to address these new scenarios. In this paper, we argue that large scale Fog-based stream processing should rely on the coordinated composition of geographically dispersed SPE instances. We propose an architecture based on the composition of multiple SPE instances and their communication via distributed message brokers. We introduce S pec K, a tool to automate the deployment and adaptation of pipelines over a Fog computing platform. Given a description of the pipeline, S pec K covers all the operations needed to deploy a stream processing computation over the different SPE instances targeted, using their own APIs and establishing the required communication channels to forward data among them. A prototypical implementation of S pec K is presented, and its performance is evaluated over Grid’5000, a large-scale, distributed experimental facility.",

		"abstract": "In this work, we consider a computational model of a distributed system formed by a set of servers in which jobs, that are continuously arriving, have to be executed. Every job is formed by a set of dependent tasks (i. e., each task may have to wait for others to be completed before it can be started), each of which has to be executed in one of the servers. The arrival and properties of jobs are assumed to be controlled by a bounded adversary, whose only restriction is that it cannot overload any server. This model is a non-trivial generalization of the Adversarial Queuing Theory model of Borodin et al. and, like that model, focuses on the stability of the system: whether the number of jobs pending to be completed is bounded at all times. We show multiple results of stability and instability for this adversarial model under different combinations of the scheduling policy used at the servers, the arrival rate, and the dependence between tasks in the jobs.",

		"abstract": "Serverless is an emerging paradigm that greatly simplifies the usage of cloud resources providing unprecedented auto-scaling, simplicity, and cost-efficiency features. Thus, more and more individuals and organizations adopt it, to increase their productivity and focus exclusively on the functionality of their application. Additionally, the cloud is expanding towards the deep edge, forming a continuum in which the event-driven nature of the serverless paradigm seems to make a perfect match. The extreme heterogeneity introduced, in terms of diverse hardware resources and frameworks available, requires systematic approaches for evaluating serverless deployments. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating serverless frameworks deployed on hybrid edge-cloud clusters. Our methodology focuses on key performance knobs of the serverless paradigm and applies a systematic way for evaluating these aspects in hybrid edge-cloud environments. We apply our methodology on three open-source serverless frameworks, OpenFaaS, Openwhisk, and Lean Openwhisk respectively, and we provide key insights regarding their performance implications over resource-constrained edge devices.",

Moreover, the need for energy-, yet performance-efficient solutions both in the edge and cloud has led to the rise of approximate computing as a promising paradigm, where “acceptable errors” are introduced to error-tolerant applications, thus, providing significant power-saving gains. In this work, we leverage approximate computing for exploiting performance-energy trade-offs of FPGA accelerated kernels with faster design time though an extended source-to-source HLS compiler based on Xilinx Vitis framework. We introduce a novel programming interface that operates at a high level of abstraction, thus, enabling automatic optimizations to the existing HLS design flow supporting both embedded and cloud devices through a common API. We evaluate our approach over three different application from DSP and machine learning domains and show that a decrease of 27% and 28% in power consumption, 61% and 69% in DSP utilization and 7% in clock period is achieved for Alveo U200 and ZCU104 FPGA platforms, on average.",

		"abstract": "The cultural and technological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be long lasting, and one of the major impacts has been the increased uptake in cloud usage. Even if organizations have not been able to make the move to cloud so far, it is part of the near-term business goals for many. In the social context, the cloud has a significant effect on human interactions; we are also saving more and more of our personal (and confidential) data on the cloud. During the first global lockdown in March 2020, the uptake in social media increased dramatically. It is predicted that the ‘new normal’ will involve a continued use of social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram as well as conferencing tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. In fact, the cloud is seen to be more crucial to everyday life now more than ever before. While good from a revenue-generating perspective for cloud operators and service providers, this is a challenging situation to manage. The post-COVID-19 cloud represents a nexus of critical drivers including cyber-security, reliability, efficiency and cost that could transform the way the cloud and its associated technologies operate. In this chapter, we therefore examine the inter-relationships between these qualities, giving specific attention to the achievement of privacy and security. A proposal is made to extend the original CIA triad, which defines the priorities that should be given when integrating security into an organization, with a focus on the achievement of confidentiality, integrity and availability; with the achievement of these, we argue that there is an overall focus on reliability. The proposed extension, which forms eCIA, advocates that network reliability be achieved in parallel with efficiency. When considered together, in a planned approach that is not applied as a bolt-on reaction to a breach, there is a careful balance to reach in the parallel achievement of all objectives. In this chapter, we consider potential ways in which the competing goals may be facilitated simultaneously.",

However, it becomes challenging to optimize the system’s behaviour, due to the Edge’s highly distributed and dynamic nature. Recent solutions propose new decentralized, self-adaptive approaches to face the needs of this scenario. One of the most challenging aspect is related to the optimization of the system’s energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized solution that limits the energy consumed by the system, without failing to match the users expectations, defined as the services’ Quality of Experience (QoE). Specifically, we propose a scheme where the autonomous coordination of entities at Edge is able to reduce the energy consumption by reducing the number of instances of the applications executed in system. This result is achieve without violating the services’ QoE, expressed in terms of latency. Experimental evaluations through simulation conducted with PureEdgeSim demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

While the combination of IoT devices and fog computing has many advantages, such as increased efficiency, reduced network traffic and better end user experience, the scale and volatility of the fog and edge also present new problems for service deployment scheduling.Fog and edge networks contain orders of magnitude more devices than cloud data centers, and they are often less stable and slower. Additionally, frequent changes in network topology and the number of connected devices are the norm in edge networks, rather than the exception as in cloud data centers.This article presents a service scheduling algorithm, labeled “Swirly”, for fog and edge networks containing hundreds of thousands of devices, which is capable of incorporating changes in network conditions and connected devices. The theoretical performance is explored, and a model of the behaviour and limits of fog nodes is constructed. An evaluation of Swirly is performed, showing that it is capable of managing service meshes for at least 300.000 devices in near real-time.",

For realisation of the use cases, it has to be understood how data is collected, stored, processed, analysed, and visualised in big data systems. In order to provide services with low latency for end users, often utilisation of ML techniques has to be optimized. Also, software/service developers have to understand, how to develop and deploy ML models in edge computing environments. Therefore, architecture design of big data systems to edge computing environments may be challenging. Findings The contribution of this paper is reference architecture (RA) design of a big data system utilising ML techniques in edge computing environments. An earlier version of the RA has been extended based on 16 realised implementation architectures, which have been developed to edge/distributed computing environments. Also, deployment of architectural elements in different environments is described. Finally, a system view is provided of the software engineering aspects of ML model development and deployment. Conclusions The presented RA may facilitate concrete architecture design of use cases in edge computing environments. The value of RAs is reduction of development and maintenance costs of systems, reduction of risks, and facilitation of communication between different stakeholders.",

		"abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, data volumes have been considerably increased. The processing resources of IoT nodes cannot cope with such huge workloads. Processing parts of the workload in clouds could solve this problem, but the quality of services for end-users will be decreased. Given the latency reduction for end-users, the concept of processing in the fog devices, which are at the edge of the network has been evolved. Optimizing the energy consumption of fog devices in comparison with cloud devices is a significant challenge. On the other hand, providing the expected-quality of service in processing the requested workloads is highly dependent on the propagation delay between fog devices and clouds, which due to the nature of the distribution of clouds with the different workloads, is highly variable. To date, none of the proposed solutions has solved the problem of workload allocation given the criteria of minimizing the energy and delay of fog devices and clouds, simultaneously. This paper presents a processing model for the problem in which a trade-off between energy consumption and delay in processing workloads in fog is formulated. This multi-objective model of the problem is solved using NSGAII algorithm. The numerical results show that by using the proposed algorithm for workload allocation in a fog-cloud scenario, both of energy-consumption and delay can be improved. Also, by allocating 25% of the IoT workloads to fog devices, the energy consumption and delay are both minimized.",

Setting up smart services and applications that would support the building process is on the wish list of every construction company. Such applications, however, have time-critical requirements that must be addressed in the application designing process. There are four broad types of converging technologies that are currently used to build smart applications. These include the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing and Blockchain. The EU-Korean research and innovation project DECENTER intends to play a pivotal role in the integration of such technologies in a new Fog Computing Platform. The DECENTER Fog Computing Platform would help address the resource requirements of smart applications and provide high Quality of Service (QoS) to various AI-based applications. Due to the various uncertainties of the Fog Computing environment, the project aims at also providing Service Level Agreements for the offered services, which include assurances, ranking and verification of Edge-to-Cloud deployment options. Our present work focuses on the use of stochastic methods, particularly, the Markov Decision Process to deliver a QoS model of the smart application in relation to the available Cloud computing resources. This work presents the algorithm, which is used to achieve high QoS of smart applications and its implementation considerations. Our findings support the understanding that dynamic Edge-to-Cloud computing environments require a stochastic approach to establish assurances for high QoS operation of the applications. It is shown that the required assurances can be expressed as a probability value for confidence, which is calculated by the stochastic method.",

Simultaneously, edge devices have become powerful enough to run containerized microservices, while remaining small and low-powered. These evolutions have triggered a wave of research into container placement strategies on clusters including edge devices, leading to concepts such as fog computing. These container placement strategies can optimize workload placement across cloud and edge clusters, but current container orchestrators are very resource intensive and are not designed to run on edge devices. This paper presents FLEDGE as a Kubernetes compatible edge container orchestrator. A number of aspects of how to achieve low-resource container orchestration are examined, for example the choice of container runtime and how to implement container networking. Finally, a number of evaluations are performed, comparing FLEDGE to K3S and Kubernetes, to show that it is a viable alternative to existing container orchestrators.",

Microservices’ single functionality, small size, and independent development/deployment support faster and cheaper scaling of pressing functionalities on cloud systems. They support applications’ evolution via service reuse and smooth service modification/inclusion. Individual or sets of inter-related services may also be dynamically deployed onto resource-restricted nodes closer to end devices and data sources, which are typical of fog/edge computational platforms. The resulting system is very complex and impossible to be adequately managed manually.

In the coming decades, we will be surrounded by billions of sensors, devices, and machines, the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world becomes more connected, we will become dependent on machines to make decisions on our behalf. When machines use data from sensors, devices, and other machines (i.e., things) to make decisions, they need to learn how to trust Trust that data, as well as the things they are interacting with. As cyber physical systems become more commonplace in IoT and smart city Smart city applications, it is essential that decision makers are able to trust Trust the machines making decisions on their behalf. This chapter defines trust Trust from a multidimensional perspective, which includes reliability Reliability . It describes a set of research projects conducted that span the multiple dimensions of trust Trust . While the research described spans a range of trust Trust topics, little has been done on the relevance of trust Trust to simulation. Simulations that use and interact with real-world systems is growing, which means understanding their trustworthiness Trustworthiness is of growing importance.

		"abstract": "Wildland fires and related hazards are increasing globally. A common observation across these large events is that fire behavior is changing to be more destructive, making applied fire research more important and time critical. Significant improvements towards modeling of the extent and dynamics of evolving plethora of fire related environmental hazards, and their socio-economic and human impacts can be made through intelligent integration of modern data and computing technologies with techniques for data management, machine learning and fire modeling. However, there are still challenges and opportunities in integration of the scientific discoveries and data-driven methods for hazards with the advances in technology and computing in a way that provides and enables different modalities of sensing and computing. The WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure took the first steps to tackle this problem with a goal to create an integrated system, data and visualization services, and workflows for wildfire monitoring, simulation, and response. Today, WIFIRE provides an end-to-end management infrastructure from the data sensing and collection to artificial intelligence and modeling efforts using a continuum of computing methods that integrate edge, cloud, and high-performance computing. Through this cyberinfrastructure, the WIFIRE project provides data driven knowledge for a wide range of public and private sector users enabling scientific, municipal, and educational use. This paper (based on the keynote by the author) reviews some of our recent work on building this dynamic data driven cyberinfrastructure and impactful application solution architectures that showcase integration of a variety of existing technologies and collaborative expertise.",

		"abstract": "Critical infrastructures are bringing security, and safety for people in terms of healthcare, water, electricity, industry, transportation, etc. The huge amount of data produced by CIs need to be aggregated, filtered, and stored. Cloud computing was merged into the CIs for utilizing cloud data centers as a pay-as-you-go online computing system for outsourcing services for data storage, filtering and aggregating. On the other hand, CIs need real-time processing for providing sophisticated services to people. Consequently, fog computing is merged into CIs aimed at providing services closer to the users, turning into a smooth real-time decision making and processing. When considering both, that is fog and cloud (for example, deploying the recently coined hierarchical fog-to-cloud F2C concept), new enriched features may be applied to the CIs. Security in CIs is one of the most essential challenges since any failure or attack can turn into a national wise disaster. Moreover, CIs also need to support quality of service (QoS) guarantees for users. Thus, bringing balanced QoS vs security is one of the main challenges for any CI infrastructure. In this paper, we illustrate the benefits of deploying an F2C system in CIs, particularly identifying specific F2C security requirements to be applied to CIs. Finally, we also introduce a decoupled security architecture specifically tailored to CIs that can bring security with reasonable QoS in terms of authentication and key distribution time delay.",

In this hybrid and distributed ecosystem, the management of service heterogeneity is complex, as well as, the service provisioning based on the classification and allocation of suitable computational resources remains a challenge. Osmotic Computing (OC), a new promising paradigm that allows the service migrations ensuring beneficial resource utilization within Cloud, Edge, and Fog Computing environments, was introduced as a potential solution to these issues. Driven by the needs of complex management mitigation, greater agility, flexibility and scalability, this paper aims to propose an innovative OC ecosystem leveraging Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS); there is also introduced the concept of hybrid architectural style combining both microservices and serverless architectures. Furthermore, to support the FaaS-based OC ecosystem, an osmotic flow model for video surveillance in smart cities is presented. To validate the functionality and assess the performance and to further improve the understanding of the usability of the OC flow in real-world applications, several experiments have been carried out.",

Indeed, it requires fulfilling all application requirements, whilst determining a trade-off among different objectives (i.e., QoS assurance, Fog resource consumption and cost), resulting in a complex and time-consuming decision-making process to be tuned manually. In this paper, we present a simple multi-objective optimisation scheme that permits selecting the best placement of application components, balancing the trade-off among QoS-assurance, Fog resource consumption and monthly deployment costs.

The key distinctive idea of Fluidware is to abstract collectives of devices of the IoT fabric as sources, digesters, and targets of distributed “flows” of contextualized events, carrying information about data produced and actuating commands. Accordingly, programming of services and applications relies on declarative specification of “funnel processes” to channel, elaborate, and re-direct such flows in a fully-distributed way, as a means to coordinate the activities of devices and realize services and applications. The potential applicability of Fluidware and its expected advantages are exemplified via a case study scenario in the area of ambient assisted living.",

Realizing the full vision of smart campus needs an instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent cyber physical system leveraging ICTs and physical infrastructures in the campus. Moreover, the study of a smart campus could pave a way for studying smart cities. In a smart campus, heterogeneous big data is continuously generated by the different functional sensing devices. This poses great challenges on the computation, transmission, storage, and energy consumption of traditional sensor-to-cloud continuum, which typically incurs huge amount of network transmission, high energy consumption, and long (sometimes intolerable) processing delay. Based on these observations, we propose a fog-enabled smart campus to enhance the real-time service provisioning. An architecture of smart campus is put forward, in which multiple fog nodes are deployed to guarantee the real-time performance of services and applications by performing tasks at the network edge. Furthermore, a lot of open research issues regarding to this architecture are discussed in hope to inspire to expand more research activities in this field.",

For better support of future edge analytics, in this work, we propose a novel, holistic approach for architecturing elastic edge storage services, featuring three aspects, namely, (i) data/system characterization (e.g., metrics, key properties), (ii) system operations (e.g., filtering, sampling), and (iii) data processing utilities (e.g., recovery, prediction).

Network functions between the edge and the cloud can be dynamically provisioned and managed through service APIs. Microservice architectures are increasingly used to simplify engineering, deployment and management of distributed services in not only cloud-based powerful machines but also in light-weighted devices.

However, the ever-changing demand for computational capabilities pushes data centres (DCs) to adopt power-hungry solutions. The problem of reducing energy consumption in a DC is exacerbated by the difficulties in fairly distributing the workload among the available physical servers. Current methods rely on algorithmic solutions which are not able to capture and counterbalance all the changes in the user access pattern. It leads to an over-provisioning of the resources and to an underutilisation of the active servers. This chapter advocates for an effective way to tackle the resource allocation problem with the aim of improving energy efficiency and reliability. We show how a flexible framework, designed to foreseen expected load and to use an evolutionary optimisation algorithm (such as particle swarm optimization – PSO), can efficiently map the user requests with the available hardware resources.",

However, the large amount of computation and data generated from the network edge becomes the major bottleneck, and the traditional cloud-based computing mode has been unable to meet the requirements of realtime processing tasks. To solve the above problems, by embedding AI model training and inference capabilities into the network edge, edge intelligence (EI) becomes a cutting-edge direction in the field of AI. Furthermore, collaborative DNN inference among the cloud, edge, and end devices provides a promising way to boost EI. Nevertheless, at present, EI oriented collaborative DNN inference is still in its early stage, lacking systematic classification and discussion of existing research efforts. Motivated by it, we have comprehensively investigated recent studies on EI-oriented collaborative DNN inference. In this paper, we first review the background and motivation of EI. Then, we classify four typical collaborative DNN inference paradigms for EI, and analyse their characteristics and key technologies.

		"abstract": "The recent evolutionary trend of modern applications is towards a development paradigm that involves the composition of multiple interconnected micro-services devoted to perform specific functions. Such applications usually rely on data collected by geographically distributed sensors or by mobile users and are often characterized by strict requirements in terms of latency and response time. These requirements may be not compatible with the traditional cloud computing approach, where the computation occurring on far-away data centers cannot always guarantee the satisfaction of latency constraints. The fog computing approach has recently received a lot of attention as a promising solution in supporting time-critical applications. Due to an intermediate layer of fog nodes located close to sensors or final users and able to process the application data, indeed, the fog systems may significantly reduce the experienced response time. In a scenario where applications are composed by a chain of multiple micro-services, however, the service placement over the nodes of the fog infrastructure represents a nontrivial issue with respect to the cloud computing context. The highly distributed and heterogeneous nature of the fog nodes requires novel solutions taking into account the different performance of the fog nodes and the network delays caused by inter-nodes connectivity. This paper proposes a performance model for the placement of application micro-services over the fog infrastructure. To face the computational complexity of the optimization model, an heuristic based on a genetic algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, the analytical model is validated by means of simulation. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated under a wide set of scenario and parameters ranges, including a case study based on realistic micro-services characterized through a prototype implementation.",

		"abstract": "Distributed computing continuum systems (DCCS) make use of a vast number of computing devices to process data generated by edge devices such as the Internet of Things and sensor nodes. Besides performing computations, these devices also produce data including, for example, event logs, configuration files, network management information. When these data are analyzed, we can learn more about the devices, such as their capabilities, processing efficiency, resource usage, and failure prediction. However, these data are available in different forms and have different attributes due to the highly heterogeneous nature of DCCS. The diversity of data poses various challenges which we discuss by relating them to big data, so that we can utilize the advantages of big data analytical tools. We enumerate several existing tools that can perform the monitoring task and also summarize their characteristics. Further, we provide a general governance and sustainable architecture for DCCS, which reflects the human body’s self-healing model. The proposed model has three stages: first, it analyzes system data to acquire knowledge; second, it can leverage the knowledge to monitor and predict future conditions; and third, it takes further actions to autonomously solve any issue or to alert administrators. Thus, the DCCS model is designed to minimize the system’s downtime while optimizing resource usage. A small set of data is used to illustrate the monitoring and prediction of the performance of a system through Bayesian network structure learning. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the governance and sustainability model, and we provide possible solutions to overcome them and make the system more efficient.",

These systems are concurrently executed on multiple computing tiers: cloud, fog, edge, and IoT. This simple idea develops many challenges due to the inherent complexity of their underlying infrastructures, to the extent that current methodologies for managing Internet-distributed systems would no longer be appropriate for them. To this end, we present a new methodology, based on a mathematical artifact called Markov blanket, to cope with complex characteristics of distributed computing continuum systems. We also develop the concept of equilibrium for these systems, providing a more flexible management framework compared with the currently used threshold-based ones. Because developing the entire methodology requires a great effort, we finish the chapter with an overview of the techniques required to develop this methodology.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, owners and developers of deep learning models must consider stringent privacy-preservation rules of their training data, usually crowd-sourced and retaining sensitive information. The most widely adopted method to enforce privacy guarantees of a deep learning model nowadays relies on optimization techniques enforcing differential privacy. According to the literature, this approach has proven to be a successful defence against several models’ privacy attacks, but its downside is a substantial degradation of the models’ performance. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of the differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm against standard optimization practices with regularization techniques. We analyze the resulting models’ utility, training performance, and the effectiveness of membership inference and model inversion attacks against the learned models. Finally, we discuss differential privacy’s flaws and limits and empirically demonstrate the often superior privacy-preserving properties of dropout and l2-regularization.",

		"abstract": "Fog and edge computing paradigms increase the performance of IoT systems compared to those based exclusively on conventional cloud computing. Basically, they propose to move software services that process information to a nearby place where IoT data is collected instead of at the core of the network. The computing continuum concept goes a step further and proposes to run such software services in a transparent manner at any of the different computing paradigms and, if the execution context changes (for example due to unforeseen contingencies), to move the services to other devices if they may increase performance. In this context, advanced mechanisms are required to successfully transfer those software services to devices hosted in different computing platforms located anywhere from the edge to the cloud. This article proposes the Edge Cloud Computing ontology (ECO), an ontology for IoT systems composed of devices and data centers hosted in edge, fog or cloud computing environments. We also expose an example scenario based on a service architecture on which ECO facilitates management actions. These actions include detecting the overload status of system elements, proposals for suitable locations for software deployment or identifying elements potentially affected by problems in the system, such as connection link failures.",

Related constructs such as Attitude to use , Behavioral intention to use and External variables cannot be easily operationalised and so are often ignored. However, technology characteristics themselves fail to represent other factors such as potential adopter attitudes and how they react to the opportunities offered by the technology to meet their needs. In a series of three studies, qualitative methods were used to identify, validate and then exploit narrative themes. Based on the short narratives of potential adopters discussing their experiences with a set of cybersecurity tools, we are developing a small-story narrative framework to capture how they respond to the technology contextualised directly within their professional environment. Akin to concepts from adoption frameworks in healthcare intervention studies, we conclude that adopter’s personal response to a technology and how they make sense of it in their environment becomes evident in the narratives they create.",

Applications are not aware of using a remote GPU. However, overall performance depends on the throughput of the underlying network connecting the application to the remote GPUs. One way to increase this bandwidth is to compress transmissions made within the remote GPU virtualization middleware between the application side and the GPU side. In this paper we make a two-fold contribution. On the one hand, we present a new compression benchmark with more than 40 compression libraries. On the other hand, we have gathered the internal transmissions of a remote GPU virtualization middleware while executing 4 popular artificial intelligence applications. With these data we have created a new dataset for testing compression libraries in this specific domain. Both, the new compression benchmark and the new dataset are publicly available.",

		"abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC), as an extension of the cloud computing paradigm to edge networks, overcomes some obstacles of traditional mobile cloud computing by offering ultra-short latency and less core network traffic. The edge resources are virtualized to be shared among multiple mobile users. Consolidated server systems using server virtualization involves serious risks of hosting server failures. Redundant virtual machine placement can be an effective countermeasure. This problem has been well solved in cloud computing. However, it is a more nontrivial task to efficiently deploy virtual machines redundantly in MEC networks. To address this issue, a redundant virtual machine placement method in MEC is proposed. Firstly, this method estimates the minimum number of virtual machines required based on the performance requirements of the applications. Then, the redundant virtual machine placement problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization formulation. Finally, a optimal placement strategy searching algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal location of the virtual machines. The strategy can preserve the minimum configuration in the event of failure of any k edge servers. The experiment results illustrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

		"abstract": "is a new binary instruction format and runtime environment capable of executing both client side and server side workloads. With its numerous advantages, including drastically reduced cold start times, efficiency, easy portability, and compatibility with the most popular programming languages today, it has the potential to revolutionize serverless computing. We evaluate the impact of WebAssembly in terms of serverless computing, building on top of existing research related to WebAssembmly in cloud and edge environments. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmarking suite comprised of 13 different functions, compatible with WebAssembly, and focusing on both microbenchmarking and real-world workloads. We also discuss possibilities of integrating WebAssembly runtimes with the application programming interfaces and command line interfaces of popular container runtimes, representing an initial step towards potential reuse of existing orchestration engines in the future, thus solving the open issue of WebAssembly workload scheduling. We evaluate the performance of such an integration by comparing the cold start delays and total execution times of three WebAssembly runtimes: WasmEdge, Wasmer, and Wasmtime to the performance of the containerd container runtime, using distroless and distro-oriented container images. Results show that WebAssembly runtimes show better results in 10 out of 13 tests, with Wasmtime being the fastest WebAssembly runtime among those evaluated. Container runtimes still offer better compute performance for complex workloads requiring larger execution times, in cases where cold start times are negligible compared to the total execution time.",

		"abstract": "The Internet is becoming more centralized, more asymmetric in terms of knowledge and power distribution, more biased, less privacypreserving and less trustworthy. Blockchain technologies already enable the safe and fair exchange of digital assets in a decentralized manner; however, its application to information exchange remains largely unexplored. This article exposes our vision for a semantically-enriched blockchain software ecosystem named ONTOCHAIN, that enables the development of trustworthy distributed applications that can empower users, guarantee both their privacy and high quality of service, and ultimately support pluralism and democracy. ONTOCHAIN aims primarily to attain trustworthy service exchange and trustworthy content handling by means of advanced knowledge management mechanisms for several domains such as health, economy, public services, energy and sustainability, news, media, entertainment, Industry 4.0 and tourism. We present the main components of the ONTOCHAIN architecture and their functionality. Finally, the validity of our approach is exemplified by describing how decentralized applications can be enabled by the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Networks are always evolving to meet the needs of progressing and novel applications. To this end, improved network capacity, latency and security are required. Monitoring is key to achieving these objectives. It is a cornerstone for the uninterrupted network operation and the applications’ QoS management. Network tomography uses a subset of monitoring information, corresponding to partial view of the network state, to estimate wide-sense network performance metrics. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning (ML) formulation for Network Tomography. It is novel in that its features are designed under the assumption that: (i) the existence of certain links of the network is not known (e.g., due to security reasons), (ii) the routing is dynamic (non-deterministic), i.e., for the same origin–destination node pair, a different route may be selected depending on the state of certain links. These assumptions are typically present in modern networks. The formulation can be used to estimate both additive and non-additive performance metrics. We evaluate our proposal using different ML algorithms: neural networks (NNs), Gaussian regression and linear regression with interactions. Our simulations indicate that our ML formulation has better estimation accuracy compared to traditional algebraic or other ML approaches that cannot or do not take into account these two hypotheses. Regarding the accuracy of the examined ML algorithms, the differences mainly depend on the additive or not nature of the network metrics.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            Recently, the convergence between Blockchain and IoT has been appealing in many domains including, but not limited to, healthcare, supply chain, agriculture, and telecommunication. Both Blockchain and IoT are sophisticated technologies whose feasibility and performance in large-scale environments are difficult to evaluate. Consequently, a trustworthy Blockchain-based IoT simulator presents an alternative to costly and complicated actual implementation. Our primary analysis finds that there has not been so far a satisfactory simulator for the creation and assessment of blockchain-based IoT applications, which is the principal impetus for our effort. Therefore, this study gathers the thoughts of experts about the development of a simulation environment for blockchain-based IoT applications. To do this, we conducted two different investigations. First, a questionnaire is created to determine whether the development of such a simulator would be of substantial use. Second, interviews are conducted to obtain participants’ opinions on the most pressing challenges they encounter with blockchain-based IoT applications. The outcome is a conceptual architecture for simulating blockchain-based IoT applications that we evaluate using two research methods; a questionnaire and a focus group with experts. All in all, we find that the proposed architecture is generally well-received due to its comprehensive range of key features and capabilities for blockchain-based IoT purposes.",

However, in its rawest form, data are usually not usable. Developers, data engineers, analytics experts, and data scientists are working on creating information from data by linking relevant data elements and giving them meaning. By adding context, knowledge is created [5]. In the case of AIoT, knowledge is the foundation of actionable intelligence (Fig. 3.1).",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            IoT systems are becoming an essential part of our environment. Smart cities, smart manufacturing, augmented reality, and self-driving cars are just some examples of the wide range of domains, where the applicability of such systems have been increasing rapidly. These IoT use cases often require simultaneous access to geographically distributed arrays of sensors, heterogeneous remote, local as well as multi-cloud computational resources. This gives birth to the extended Cloud-to-Things computing paradigm. The emergence of this new paradigm raised the quintessential need to extend the orchestration requirements (i.e., the automated deployment and run-time management) of applications from the centralised cloud-only environment to the entire spectrum of resources in the Cloud-to-Things continuum. In order to cope with this requirement, in the last few years, there has been a lot of attention to the development of orchestration systems in both industry and academic environments. This paper is an attempt to gather the research conducted in the orchestration for the Cloud-to-Things continuum landscape and to propose a detailed taxonomy, which is then used to critically review the landscape of existing research work. We finally discuss the key challenges that require further attention and also present a conceptual framework based on the conducted analysis.",
