		"abstract": "Robotic systems are more connected, networked, and distributed than ever. New architectures that comply with the de facto robotics middleware standard, ROS 2, have recently emerged to fill the gap in terms of hybrid systems deployed from edge to cloud. This paper reviews new architectures and technologies that enable containerized robotic applications to seamlessly run at the edge or in the cloud. We also overview systems that include solutions from extension to ROS 2 tooling to the integration of Kubernetes and ROS 2. Another important trend is robot learning, and how new simulators and cloud simulations are enabling, e.g., large-scale reinforcement learning or distributed federated learning solutions. This has also enabled deeper integration of continuous interaction and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for robotic systems development, going beyond standard software unit tests with simulated tests to build and validate code automatically. We discuss the current technology readiness and list the potential new application scenarios that are becoming available. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in distributed robotic systems and list open research questions in the field.",

		"abstract": "The edge-cloud continuum is an advanced paradigm for cloud computing, which brings data storage and compute power closer to users or devices, and as a result, eliminates lag time and saves bandwidth. However, this new paradigm is harsh for secure storage and computation due to the separation of data ownership and control. Data security, especially outsourced data integrity in the edge-cloud resilient network, becomes one of the most fundamental challenges. To check the outsourced data integrity and address the efficient key update issue in this scenario, in this article, we propose a framework of outsourced data integrity checking with a practical key update in the edge-cloud resilient network. We first review the existing outsourced data integrity checking algorithms and then put forward a potential solution to achieving outsourced data integrity checking with a practical key update, which is composed of three phases, namely key request and update, local data upload, and outsourced data integrity auditing. We implement a prototype system for our proposal as well, which demonstrates its practicality.",

An answer to the underlying network concerns, such as the need to lower the resulting latency due to heavy computation needs, or safety aspects, gave rise to Edge/Fog computing, where IoT functionality can be also supported closer to data sources. While it is today feasible to perform some IoT functionality on the Edge, the orchestration of operations between Edge and Cloud requires an automated support, where context-awareness plays a key role in assisting the network in deciding when and where to store data and to perform computation. This work is focused on the application of context-awareness to support a smoother operation of the Edge to Cloud operation, aiming at lowering latency, in particular when real-time or close-to-real-time data exchange is present.",

		"abstract": "Modern cloud-edge-device computational platforms does not match the needs of artificial intelligence at the edge of the network. Indeed, the lack of computing power allows that only some AI processes can be performed on edge devices, having also to consider their constrained energy capacity. Moreover, the lack of computing continuum between nodes of the same layer, i.e., edge-to-edge, allows to only operate independently within the layer by sensing the environment where nodes stay. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework for collaborative nodes with decentralized edge intelligence. Organized like a swarm, the groups of nodes emphasize the edge-to-edge continuum of the device-edge-cloud paradigm. This supports a paradigm shift from programming environments for individual devices to dynamic and cooperating groups of nodes. The nodes’ coordination relays on green overlay and offloading mechanisms. Innovative mesh architectures with mixed topologies allow building overlays for having swarm coordination. Tasks offloading exploits the overlays to balance the swarm in near-real-time, according to forecasted energy consumption. Stemming from the proposed reference architecture, we also discuss a series of open challenges, which we believe represent relevant research directions in the nearest future.",

		"abstract": "Sensor-driven IoT systems are well-known for their capacity to accelerate massive amounts of data in a comparatively short period of time. To have any use, the information delivery and decision making based on the data require efficient learning models together with dynamically deployed computing and network resources. The current cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures, as well as modern edge computing systems especially in the 5G and beyond networks, can be addressed to resolve these challenges. However, there are several application areas especially in vehicular and urban computing, where just harnessing more computational power does not solve computational and real-time requirements of the modern sensing systems that operate in mobile and context-dependent environments. For now, the mathematical challenges of distributed computing and real-time learning algorithms have not been profoundly addressed in the context of the IoT and real-world sensing applications. Data-driven systems also require giving full attention to information delivery, data management, data cleaning, and sensor fusion technologies that need to be equally distributed and real-time competent as the learning algorithms themselves. New software-defined computing and networking approaches and architectures are required to orchestrate the numerous connected resources dynamically, controllably, and securely along with the evolving needs. The key challenge here is to uniform collaboration between different aspects of the system, from data processing and delivery to the algorithms and learning models, not forgetting the computational capacity and networking capabilities, all this in real-time with real-world applications.",

		"abstract": "Serverless functions have emerged as a useful abstraction to manage the complexity of distributed and heterogeneous edge-cloud infrastructure. Current cloud-centric orchestration services and serverless platforms are not suitable for the edge-cloud continuum due to their mobility-unawareness. In this paper, we present a mobility-aware framework for edgecloud systems, where the operational mechanisms of placement, scaling, and routing of serverless functions work in tandem. To that end, we formulate the concept of pressure that captures complex system behavior in a single metric. The pressure-based framework handles geo-distributed workload and user mobility by reducing overall function latency and increasing data throughput while efficiently using edge resources. Our contributions include a novel framework revolving around pressure and a realworld proof of concept evaluation. Our approach combines the benefits of a centralized control-plane with a decentralized dataplane. The results show the efficacy of the platform to address operational goals and make effective and deterministic tradeoffs between system utilization and application performance. The novel concept of pressure shows great extensibility and builds the base for a plethora of future works.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays Osmotic Computing is emerging as one of the paradigms used to guarantee the Cloud Continuum, and this popularity is strictly related to the capacity to embrace inside it some hot topics like containers, microservices, orchestration and Function as a Service (FaaS). The Osmotic principle is quite simple, it aims to create a federated heterogeneous infrastructure, where an application's components can smoothly move following a concentration rule. In this work, we aim to solve two big constraints of Osmotic Computing related to the incapacity to manage dynamic access rules for accessing the applications inside the Osmotic Infrastructure and the incapacity to keep alive and secure the access to these applications even in presence of network disconnections. For overcoming these limits we designed and implemented a new Osmotic component, that acts as an eventually consistent distributed peer to peer access management system. This new component is used to keep a local Identity and Access Manager (IAM) that permits at any time to access the resource available in an Osmotic node and to update the access rules that allow or deny access to hosted applications. This component has been already integrated inside a Kubernetes based Osmotic Infrastructure and we presented two typical use cases where it can be exploited.",

		"abstract": "Deep Learning has shifted the focus of traditional batch workflows to data-driven feature engineering on streaming data. In particular, the execution of Deep Learning workflows presents expectations of near-real-time results with user-defined acceptable accuracy. Meeting the objectives of such applications across heterogeneous resources located at the edge of the network, the core, and in-between requires managing trade-offs between the accuracy and the urgency of the results. However, current data analysis rarely manages the entire Deep Learning pipeline along the data path, making it complex for developers to implement strategies in realworld deployments. Driven by an object detection use case, this paper presents an architecture for time-critical Deep Learning workflows by providing a data-driven scheduling approach to distribute the pipeline across Edge to Cloud resources. Furthermore, it adopts a data management strategy that reduces the resolution of incoming data when potential trade-off optimizations are available. We illustrate the system's viability through a performance evaluation of the object detection use case on the Grid'5000 testbed. We demonstrate that in a multi-user scenario, with a standard frame rate of 25 frames per second, the system speed-up data analysis up to 54.4% compared to a Cloud-only-based scenario with an analysis accuracy higher than a fixed threshold.",

In addition, we are experiencing an increment of critical applications using an increasing volume of sensitive data and requiring advanced security and privacy protections. 5G Edge technology can foster a more diffused Edge computing adoption but several challenges in terms of interoperability. Handling data-intensive pipelines on the 5Genabled Edge continuum, considering specific QoS requirements including security and privacy, is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose an initial solution for deploying a data-intensive pipeline in a 5G-enabled Edge continuum satisfying specific QoS requirements. Our approach is based on a QoS-aware meta orchestration modeling of a given pipeline and an orchestration builder generating deployable Edge-specific orchestrations.

In this paper, we study the efficient provisioning and management of compute resources in the Edge-to-Cloud continuum for different types of real-time applications with timeliness requirements depending on application-level update rates and communication/compute delays. We begin by introducing a highly stylized network model allowing us to study the salient features of this problem including its sensitivity to compute vs. communication costs, application requirements, and traffic load variability. We then propose an online decentralized service placement algorithm, based on estimating network delays and adapting application update rates, which achieves high service availability. Our results exhibit how placement can be optimized and how a load-balancing strategy can achieve near-optimal service availability in large networks.",

		"abstract": "The massive penetration of Renewables into the energy mix and the existence of IoT-enabled Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the emerging smart grid, while a blessing towards de-carbonization, increase considerably the operations and planning functions of the grid. Cloud processing of IoT/DER data facilitates the deployment of various Demand-Response (DR) and other DER asset scenarios, the organization of distribution grids into Local Energy Markets (LEM) and the efficient computation of load forecasting and power flow. Cloud computing enables a plethora of service provisions to the grid including frequency response. The decentralized nature of DERs at the edge of the distribution grid requires nodal approaches for the computation of power grid congestion constraints and power flow solutions. We present here a cloud-edge continuum approach, anchored on the new generation of communications infrastructure, which expedites the computation time of the load and DER forecasting and optimal power flow calculations. The proposed approach allows the LEM operator to respond to Fast Frequency Response service procurement signals issued by the balancing authority requiring even sub-second latency for service settlement. The proposed cloud-edge architecture has been tested on the IEEE European Low Voltage Benchmark model and provides scalability and elasticity for various DR/DER configurations.",

In such multi-tier environments, it is crucial to adopt an efficient resource allocation and scheduling scheme, in order to provide effective load balancing and timeliness for the real-time workload. A load balancing approach that has been proven to be efficient and effective in traditional distributed environments, is the power of two choices – or d choices, in its general form. Only recently has this technique been examined in multi-tier environments, without considering, however, important aspects of such frameworks. To this end, in this paper we propose and investigate three resource allocation and scheduling heuristics for real-time workflow jobs in an IoT-fog-cloud environment. The first strategy, performs exhaustive search at each scheduling step in order to find the most suitable resource in the fog and cloud layers for the workload assignment. On the other hand, the two other policies adopt the power of two choices approach. The simulation results shed light on interesting insights regarding the performance and applicability of each method.",

Edge computing has emerged as a viable approach to mitigate the latency by offloading tasks to nodes nearby the data sources; at the same time, few industrial case studies have been reported so far. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of the SEAWALL platform for the heterogeneous data acquisition and low-latency processing in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The framework has been developed within the homonymous project founded by the Italian BIREX industrial consortium and involving both academic and industrial partners.

In addition, it enables the seamless orchestration of workloads in the edge-cloud continuum so that the latency of the alerting service is minimized requirement of the processing task is continuously met, while taking into account the constrained resources of the edge servers.

		"abstract": "Serverless computing has made a significant impact in the cloud computing landscape, and has even been extended beyond the cloud, up to the edge of the network. Existing serverless platforms which use containers and micro virtual machines as function runtimes incur a significant startup latency, hindering the performance and scalability of the executed functions. One potential solution to this problem is the use of WebAssembly. In this paper we discuss recent developments which allow WebAssembly to be used for serverside applications, as well as serverless functions, and evaluate potential orchestration options with the end goal of integrating WebAssembly with existing cloud and edge infrastructure. We conclude that while WebAssembly is a solution to the cold start problem, further work is needed in this area. To realize the endgoal of seamless and user-friendly serverless platforms that can be deployed across the edge-cloud continuum and can dynamically adapt to compute and latency requirements, WebAssembly should not be seen as the exclusive technology, and instead multiple runtime environments should be supported in addition to WebAssembly.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of edge-cloud continuum solutions to efficiently collect and analyze data generated by IoT devices. In this paper, we investigate to what extent these solutions can manage tasks related to urban mobility, by combining real-time and low latency analysis offered by the edge with large computing and storage resources provided by the cloud. Our proposal is organized into three parts. The first part focuses on defining three application scenarios in which geotagged data generated by IoT objects, such as taxis, cars, and smartphones, are collected and analyzed through machine learning-based algorithms (i.e., next location prediction, location-based advertising, and points of interest recommendation). The second part is dedicated to modeling an edge-cloud continuum architecture capable of managing a large number of IoT devices and executing machine learning algorithms to analyze the data they generate. The third part analyzes the experimental results in which different design choices were evaluated, such as the number of devices and orchestration policies, to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms in terms of processing time, network delay, task failure, and computational resource utilization. The results highlight the potential benefits of edge and cloud cooperation in the three application scenarios, demonstrating that it significantly improves resource utilization and reduces the task failure rate compared to other widely adopted architectures, such as edge- or cloud-only architectures.",

However, such rich source of information is mostly left untapped. Thus, in this paper, we propose distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) over edge visual Internet of Things (VIoT) devices for parallel, real-time video scene parsing and indexing in conjunction with BigQuery retrieval on stored data in the cloud. The IoT video streams parsed into adaptive meta-data of person, attributes, actions, object, and relations using pre-trained DNNs. The meta-data cached at the edge-cloud for real-time analytics and also continuously transferred to the cloud for data fusion and BigQuery batch processing. The proposed distributed deep learning search platform bridges the gap between edge-to-cloud continuum computation by utilizing state-of-the-art distributed deep learning and BigQuery search algorithms for the geo-distributed Visual Internet of Things (VIoT). We show that our proposed system supports real-time event-driven computing at 122 milliseconds on virtual IoT devices in parallel, and as low as 2.4 seconds batch query response time on multi-table JOIN and GROUP-BY aggregation.",

		"abstract": "The Web of Things (WoT) standard recently promoted by the W3C constitutes a promising approach to devise interoperable IoT systems able to cope with the heterogeneity of software platforms and devices. The WoT architecture envisages interconnected IoT scenarios characterized by a multitude of Web Things (WTs) that interact according to well-defined software interfaces; at the same time, it assumes static allocations of WTs to hosting devices, and it does not cope with the intrinsic dynamicity of IoT environments in terms of time-varying network and computational loads. In this paper, we extend the WoT paradigm for cloud-edge continuum deployments, hence supporting dynamic orchestration and mobility of WTs among the available computational resources. Differently from state-of-art Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) approaches, we heavily exploit the W3C WoT, and specifically its capability to standardize the software interfaces of the WTs, in order to propose the concept of a Migratable WoT (M-WoT), in which WTs are seamlessly allocated to hosts according to their dynamic interactions. Three main contributions are proposed in this paper. First, we describe the architecture of the M-WoT framework, by focusing on the stateful migration of WTs and on the management of the WT handoff process. Second, we rigorously formulate the WT allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose a graph-based heuristic. Third, we describe a container-based implementation of M-WoT and a twofold evaluation, through which we assess the performance of the proposed migration policy in a distributed edge computing setup and in a real-world IoT monitoring scenario.",

However, current serverless compute platforms do not consider data placement when scheduling functions. With the growing demand for edge-cloud continuum, multi-cloud, and multi-serverless applications, this flaw means serverless technologies are still ill-suited to latency-sensitive operations like media streaming. This work proposes a solution by presenting a tool called FaDO: FaaS Functions and Data Orchestrator, designed to allow data-aware functions scheduling across multi-serverless compute clusters present at different locations, such as at the edge and in the cloud. FaDO works through header-based HTTP reverse proxying and uses three load-balancing algorithms: 1) The Least Connections, 2) Round Robin, and 3) Random for load balancing the invocations of the function across the suitable serverless compute clusters based on the set storage policies. FaDO further provides users with an abstraction of the serverless compute cluster’s storage, allowing users to interact with data across different storage services through a unified interface. In addition, users can configure automatic and policy-aware granular data replications, causing FaDO to spread data across the clusters while respecting location constraints. Load testing results show that it is capable of load balancing high-throughput workloads, placing functions near their data without contributing any significant performance overhead.",

		"abstract": "Challenges associated with developing analytics solutions at the edge of large scale Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks close to where data is being generated in most cases involves developing analytics solutions from ground up. However, this approach increases IoT development costs and system complexities, delay time to market, and ultimately lowers competitive advantages associated with delivering next-generation IoT designs. To overcome these challenges, existing, widely available, hardware can be utilized to successfully participate in distributed edge computing for IIoT systems. In this paper, an osmotic computing approach is used to illustrate how distributed osmotic computing and existing low-cost hardware may be utilized to solve complex, compute-intensive Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) deep learning problem from the edge, through the fog, to the network cloud layer of IIoT systems. At the edge layer, the C28x digital signal processor (DSP), an existing low-cost, embedded, real-time DSP that has very wide deployment and integration in several IoT industries is used as a case study for constructing real-time graph-based Coiflet wavelets that could be used for several analytic applications including deep learning pre-processing applications at the edge and fog layers of IIoT networks. Our implementation is the first known application of the fixed-point C28x DSP to construct Coiflet wavelets. Coiflet Wavelets are constructed in the form of an osmotic microservice, using embedded low-level machine language to program the C28x at the network edge. With the graph-based approach, it is shown that an entire Coiflet wavelet distribution could be generated from only one wavelet stored in the C28x based edge device, and this could lead to significant savings in memory at the edge of IoT networks. Pearson correlation coefficient is used to select an edge generated Coiflet wavelet and the selected wavelet is used at the fog layer for pre-processing and denoising IIoT data to improve data quality for fog layer based deep learning application. Parameters for implementing deep learning at the fog layer using LSTM networks have been determined in the cloud. For XAI, communication network noise is shown to have significant impact on results of predictive deep learning at IIoT network fog layer.",

In this new ecosystem, ISs are federated and usually highly distributed becoming complex and very dynamic that have to extend not only through the Cloud/Edge and IoT layers but also the federated organizational boundaries. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) is a new paradigm driven by the significant increase in capacity/capability of resources in highly distributed and federated environments, that solves problems related to the deployment, networking and security of microservices called MicroElements (MEL) that are composed and interconnected over Cloud/Edge and IoT infrastructures with specified levels of QoS and security constraints. In this federated collaborative system, each organization needs to have proper administration and security policies to maintain data security while allowing selective sharing of resources. Classical models of access control are not effective in protecting resources while allowing users to access to the resources within their privileges. Blockchain is an underlying technology that could help organizations to improve access control systems through consensus mechanisms, and underlying features of immutability, transparency, auditability, and cryptography. In this work, we propose a MELs orchestration approach through a Software Defined Membrane (SDMem) that leverages Blockchain facilities obeying the osmosis principles.",

		"abstract": "Fog computing emerged as a new computing paradigm which moves the computing power to the proximity of users, from core to the edge of the network. It is known as the extension of Cloud computing and it offers inordinate opportunities for real-time and latency-sensitive IoT applications. An IoT application consists of a set of dependent Processing Elements (PEs) defined as operations performed on data streams and can be modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each PE performs a variety of low-level computation on the incoming data such as aggregation or filtering. A key challenge is to decide how to distribute such PEs over the resources, in order to minimize the overall response time of the entire PE graph. This problem is known as distributed PE scheduling and placement problem. In this work, we try to address the question of how fog computing paradigm can help reducing the IoT application response time by efficiently distributing PE graphs over the Fog-Cloud continuum. We mathematically formulate the fundamental characteristics of IoT application and Fog infrastructure, then model the system as an optimization problem using Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) meta-heuristic technique. Our proposed GSA model is evaluated by comparing it with a well-known evolutionary algorithm in the literature via simulation. Also, a comparative analysis with the legacy cloud infrastructure is done in order to show the significant impact of fog presence on the performance of PE processing. Evaluation of our model demonstrates the efficiency of our approach comparing to the current literature.",

		"abstract": "The development of cloud and edge computing has enabled the easy access of artificial intelligence (AI) services for massive heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices. Particularly, computation-intensive AI services can be orchestrated and deployed in the cloud or edge according to varying performance and cost requirements. Nonetheless, the improved accessibility of deep learning (DL) model variants and the evolving of computational intelligence paradigms pose great challenges for orchestrating large-scale DL inference services in the cloud-edge continuum. Focusing on cloud or edge-based deployment, existing work on multi-variant service orchestration often has a limited solution space of deployment plans. To address this limitation, we first propose a novel Multi-Paradigm Deployment Model (MPDM) for service orchestration, which not only considers the model variants but also allows the co-existence of multiple paradigms for large-scale inference service deployment. The service deployment in the MPDM model is then formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem of seeking a better trade-off among the system accuracy, service scale and deployment cost. To solve the multi-objective optimization, we further propose a weighted metric based constructive heuristic algorithm (WCH), which can efficiently obtain an approximately optimal Pareto frontier. Extensive experimental results have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of WCH, and revealed the impacts of both multi-paradigm deployment and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence (ECCI) paradigm on large-scale DL serving systems.",

Due to the inherent cyber-physical nature of these systems, many applications require that this processing respects a set of non-functional requirements (such as timeliness, or energy-efficiency). To cope with this challenge, edge-cloud architectures need to provide flexible mechanisms to support varying processing needs, whilst guaranteeing the minimum level of quality of service required by these smart applications. This paper addresses this challenge in the context of the ELASTIC software architecture, which has been developed integrating responsive data-in-motion (edge computing) and latent data-at-rest analytics (cloud computing) into a single solution, satisfying extreme-scale analytics' performance requirements. The paper focuses on how the architecture fulfils the non-functional properties inherited from the applications, namely real-time and energy-efficiency, whilst ensuring the performance of the software architecture.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, containers have gained popularity as a lightweight virtualization technology. This rise in popularity has gone hand in hand with the adoption of microservice architectures, mostly thanks to the scalable, ethereal, and isolated nature of containers. More recently, edge devices have become powerful enough to be able to run containerized microservices, while remaining flexible enough in terms of size and power to be deployed almost anywhere. This has triggered research into several container placement strategies involving edge networks, leading to concepts such as osmotic computing. While these container placement strategies are optimal in terms of workload placement, current container orchestrators are often not suitable for running on edge devices due to their high resource requirements. In this article, FLEDGE is presented as a Kubernetes-compatible container orchestrator based on Virtual Kubelets, aimed primarily at container orchestration on low-resource edge devices. Several aspects of low-resource container orchestration are examined, such as the choice of container runtime and how to realize container networking. A number of evaluations are performed to determine how FLEDGE compares to Kubernetes and K3S in terms of resource requirements, showing that it needs around 60MiB memory and 78MiB storage to run on a Raspberry Pi 3, including all dependencies, which is significantly less than both studied alternatives.",

Our framework aims to support services of arbitrary structure and complexity, dynamically configured and fluidly deployed along a heterogeneous device-to-cloud compute continuum, and operating according to provider and user intent. It features inherent privacy enhancements and aims to give users more control over their resources and data.

		"abstract": "In this work, we propose Shadows, a virtual blockchain (VC) for achieving parallel consensus and efficient management of data in industries by utilizing BC. Typically, industrial processes involve heterogeneous activities which require real-time consensus, managed execution, isolation, data sharing, accelerated computation, and efficient utilization of various computational resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Achieving these in real-time using a single conventional blockchain (BC) leads to the exertion of computational power. To achieve resource-efficient real-time consensus, we virtualize the nodes of the BC network and create different BC for various activities. Further, to virtualize BC and provide better access to data, we propose smart contracts liable for providing a unified view of a single BC, dynamically creating BCs, allocating resources to these, and making communication between the same. Through lab-scale experiments, we demonstrate that Shadows is capable of utilizing the resources efficiently and achieving real-time consensus. In particular, Shadows uses 18% CPU and 92% memory while reducing consensus time by 56%, compared to a single conventional BC. Shadows also accesses the data efficiently by utilizing smart contracts and dynamically balances the load by migrating the virtual nodes. Further, Shadows reduces the number of migrations to make the balance system by 67%.",

In these applications, it is advantageous to process data near or at the source of data to improve energy & spectrum efficiency and security, and decrease latency. Although the computation capability of edge devices has increased tremendously during the past decade, it is still challenging to perform sophisticated AI algorithms in these resource-constrained edge devices, which calls for not only low-power chips for energy efficient processing at the edge but also a system-level framework to distribute resources and tasks along the edge-cloud continuum.

A relevant and challenging task, in this context, is to identify optimal deployment models due to all the different aspects involved, such as extra-functional requirements of the system, heterogeneity of the hardware resources concerning their processing and storage capabilities, and constraints like legal issues and operational cost limits. To gain insights about the deployment decisions concerning IoT systems in practice, and the factors that influence those decisions, we report about an industrial survey we conducted with 66 IoT architects from 18 countries across the world. Each participant filled in a questionnaire that comprises 15 questions.

		"abstract": "To keep pace with the explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-dominated applications, distributed intelligence solutions are gaining momentum, which exploit cloud facilities, edge nodes and end-devices to increase the overall computational power, meet application requirements, and optimize performance. Despite the benefits in terms of data privacy and efficient usage of resources, distributing intelligence throughout the cloud-to-things continuum raises unprecedented challenges to the network design. Distributed AI/ML components need high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity to execute learning and inference tasks, while ensuring high-accuracy and energy-efficiency. This paper aims to explore the new challenging distributed intelligence scenario by extensively and critically scanning the main research achievements in the literature. In addition, starting from them, the main building blocks of a network ecosystem that can enable distributed intelligence are identified and the authors’ views are dissected to provide guidelines for the design of a “future network for distributed Intelligence\".",

		"abstract": "Mobile augmented reality (Mobile AR) is gaining increasing attention from both academia and industry. Hardware-based Mobile AR and App-based Mobile AR are the two dominant platforms for Mobile AR applications. However, hardware-based Mobile AR implementation is known to be costly and lacks flexibility, while the App-based one requires additional downloading and installation in advance and is inconvenient for cross-platform deployment. In comparison, Web-based AR (Web AR) implementation can provide a pervasive Mobile AR experience to users thanks to the many successful deployments of the Web as a lightweight and cross-platform service provisioning platform. Furthermore, the emergence of 5G mobile communication networks has the potential to enhance the communication efficiency of Mobile AR dense computing in the Web-based approach. We conjecture that Web AR will deliver an innovative technology to enrich our ways of interacting with the physical (and cyber) world around us. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art technology and existing implementations of Mobile AR, as well as enabling technologies and challenges when AR meets the Web. Furthermore, we elaborate on the different potential Web AR provisioning approaches, especially the adaptive and scalable collaborative distributed solution which adopts the osmotic computing paradigm to provide Web AR services. We conclude this paper with the discussions of open challenges and research directions under current 3G/4G networks and the future 5G networks. We hope that this paper will help researchers and developers to gain a better understanding of the state of the research and development in Web AR and at the same time stimulate more research interest and effort on delivering life-enriching Web AR experiences to the fast-growing mobile and wireless business and consumer industry of the 21st century.",

		"abstract": "Function as a Service (FaaS) is one of the widely used serverless computing service offerings to build and deploy applications on the Cloud. The platform is popular for its \"pay-as-you-go\" billing model, microservice-based design, event-driven executions, and autonomous scaling. Although it has its firm roots in Cloud computing service offerings, it is considerably explored in the Edge computing layer. The efficient resource management of FaaS is attractive to Edge computing because of the limited nature of resources. Existing literature on Edge-Cloud FaaS platforms orchestrates compute workloads based on factors such as data locality, resource availability, network costs, and bandwidth. However, the state-of-the-art platforms lack a comprehensive way to address the challenges of managing heterogeneous resources in the FaaS platform. The resource specification in a heterogeneous setting, lack of Quality of Service (QoS) driven resource provisioning, and function deployment exacerbate the problem of resource selection, and function deployment in FaaS platforms with a heterogeneous resource pool. To address these gaps, the current work presents a novel heterogeneous FaaS platform that deduces function resource specification using Machine Learning (ML) methods, performs smart function placement on Edge/Cloud based on a user-specified QoS requirement, and exploit data locality by caching appropriate data for function executions. Experimental results based on real-world workloads on a video surveillance application show that the proposed platform brings efficient resource utilization and cost savings at the Cloud by reducing the resource usage by up to 30%, while improving the performance of function executions by up to 25% at Edge and Cloud.",

		"abstract": "Traditional urban pollution monitoring systems suffer of the sole presence of fixed stations. Data gathered from such devices are precise, thanks to the equipment quality and to established and robust measuring protocols, but these sampled data are located in very limited areas and collected by discontinuous monitoring campaigns. The spread of mobile technologies has fostered the development of new approaches like Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS), offering the chance of using mobile devices, even personal ones, as sensors of urban data. Nevertheless, one of the open challenges is the management of the integration of heterogeneous data flows, different from types, technical specifications (e.g. diverse transmission protocols) and semantics. Osmotic computing aims at creating an abstract level between the mobile devices and the cloud, enabling opportunistic filtering and the addition of metadata for improving the data processing flow. This work focuses on the design and the development of the middleware which integrates data coming from mobile and IoT devices specifically deployed in urban contexts using the Osmotic Computing paradigm.",

However, the data may be sensitive (e.g., personal data or confidential commercially sensitive information), with regulatory or other requirements for its protection. Protecting sensitive data in the dynamic, heterogeneous, and decentralized cloud-to-edge continuum is very challenging. This paper describes a solution: FogProtect, an integrated set of four technologies to protect data in the cloud-to-edge continuum. Fog-Protect addresses four concerns: (i) control and enforcement of distributed data access and usage; (ii) management of distributed data protection policies; (iii) risk assessment for data assets in the cloud-to-edge continuum; (iv) automated optimisation and adaptation to address identified risks. FogProtect operates dynamically, reacting to system changes or detected vulnerabilities to keep the data secure across the cloud- to-edge continuum. This paper describes an overview of the FogProtect concept, discusses each of the four approaches, and illustrates their usage for the protection of data in three real-world use cases.",

		"abstract": "In this paper we introduce our vision of a Cognitive Computing Continuum to address the changing IT service provisioning towards a distributed, opportunistic, self-managed collaboration between heterogeneous devices outside the traditional data centre boundaries. The focal point of this continuum are cognitive devices, which have to make decisions autonomously using their on-board computation and storage capacity based on information sensed from their environment. Such devices are moving and cannot rely on fixed infrastructure elements, but instead realise on-the-fly networking and thus frequently join and leave temporal swarms. All this creates novel demands for the underlying architecture and resource management, which must bridge the gap from edge to cloud environments, while keeping the QoS parameters within required boundaries. The paper presents an initial architecture and a resource management framework for the implementation of this type of IT service provisioning.",

		"abstract": "The Edge computing extension of the Cloud services towards the network boundaries raises important placement challenges for IoT applications running in a heterogeneous environment with limited computing capacities. Unfortunately, existing works only partially address this challenge by optimizing a single or aggregate objective (e.g., response time), and not considering the edge devices’ mobility and resource constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel mobility-aware multi-objective IoT application placement (mMAPO) method in the Cloud – Edge Continuum that optimizes completion time, energy consumption, and economic cost as conflicting objectives. mMAPO utilizes a Markov model for predictive analysis of the Edge device mobility and constrains the optimization to devices that do not frequently move through the network. We evaluate the quality of the mMAPO placements using simulation and real-world experimentation on two IoT applications. Compared to related work, mMAPO reduces the economic cost by 28 percent and decreases the completion time by 80 percent while maintaining a stable energy consumption.",

However, as the variety of data sources, and the volume and velocity of data grow, processing this data while considering the uncertainty of infrastructure and timeliness constraints of urgent application workflows can be nontrivial and presents a new set of challenges. In this paper, we use an application workflow that monitors and manage the air quality impacts of remote wildfires to illustrate how the R-Pulsar programming system, leveraging the SAGE and WIFIRE platforms, can enable urgent analytics across the computing continuum. R-Pulsar supports urgent data-processing pipelines that tradeoff the content of data, cost of computation, and urgency of the results to support such workflows. We also discuss research challenges associated with programming urgent application workflows and managing resources in an autonomic manner.",

		"abstract": "More and more in recent years, IT companies have adopted edge-cloud continuum solutions to efficiently perform analysis tasks on data generated by IoT devices. As an example, in the context of urban mobility, the use of edge solutions can be extremely effective in managing tasks that require real-time analysis and low response times, such as driver assistance, collision avoidance and traffic sign recognition. On the other hand, the integration with cloud systems can be convenient for tasks that require a lot of computing resources for accessing and analyzing big data collections, such as route calculations and targeted advertising. Designing and testing such hybrid edge-cloud architectures are still open issues due to their novelty, large scale, heterogeneity, and complexity. In this paper, we analyze how the compute continuum can be exploited for efficiently managing urban mobility tasks. In particular, we focus on a case study related to taxi fleets that need to find locations where they are more likely to find new passengers. Through a simulation-based approach, we demonstrate that these solutions turn out to be effective for this class of problems, especially as the number of connected vehicles increases.",

		"abstract": "The cloud is extended towards the edge to form a computing continuum while managing resources' heterogeneity. The serverless technology simplified how to build cloud applications and use resources, becoming a driving force in consolidating the continuum with the deployment of small functions with short execution. However, the adaptation of serverless to the edge-cloud continuum brings new challenges mainly related to resource management and scheduling. Standard cloud scheduling policies are based on greedy algorithms that do not efficiently handle platforms' heterogeneity nor deal with problems such as cold start delays. This work introduces a new scheduling policy that tries to address these issues. It is based on multi-objective optimization for data transfers and makespan while considering heterogeneity. Using simulations that vary workloads, platforms, and heterogeneity levels, we study the system utilization, the trade-offs between the targets, and the impacts of considering platforms' heterogeneity. We perform comparisons with a baseline inspired by a Kubernetes-based policy, representing greedy algorithms. Our experiments show considerable gaps between the efficiency of a greedy-based scheduling policy and a multi-objective-based one. The last outperforms the baseline by reducing makespan, data transfers, and system utilization by up to two orders of magnitudes in relevant cases for the edge-cloud continuum.",

The increasing diversification of the Cloud offer, coupled with the strong need of flexible and scalable applications demanded by customers, is calling up for efficient and agile mechanisms that streamline the devops practices. The novel opportunity of running software applications or just application portions on resources located on the Edge of the network poses an additional challenge to the already tough problem of flexibly and seamlessly provisioning services. Orchestrators must deal with a continuum of heterogeneous computing resources, contributed by both the Edge and the Cloud, that promises several benefits yet at a higher management cost. In this paper, we introduce a continuum-enabled orchestrator and discuss an application provisioning paradigm that helps the users to easily configure and deploy composite applications. Finally, we showcase the potential of the orchestrator in a simple yet practical smart-city scenario.",

		"abstract": "We address distributed machine learning in multitier (e.g., mobile-edge-cloud) networks where a heterogeneous set of nodes cooperate to perform a learning task. Due to the presence of multiple data sources and computation-capable nodes, a learning controller (e.g., located in the edge) has to make decisions about (i) which distributed ML model structure to select, (ii) which data should be used for the ML model training, and (iii) which resources should be allocated to it. Since these decisions deeply influence one another, they should be made jointly. In this paper, we envision a new approach to distributed learning in multi-tier networks, which aims at maximizing ML efficiency. To this end, we propose a solution concept, called RightTrain, that achieves energy-efficient ML model training, while fulfilling learning time and quality requirements. RightTrain makes high-quality decisions in polynomial time. Further, our performance evaluation shows that RightTrain closely matches the optimum and outperforms the state of the art by over 50%.",

Deep learning technology, which has in the past been used successfully in computer vision and language modelling is now finding application in new domains driven by availability of diverse and large datasets. One such example is the advances in medical diagnostics and prediction by using Deep Learning technologies to improve human health. However, transferring large data streams (a requirement of Deep Learning technologies for achieving high accuracy) to centralised locations such as Cloud datacentre environments, in a timely and reliable manner, is being seen as a key limitation of expanding the application horizons of such technologies. To this end, various paradigms, including Osmotic Computing, have been proposed that promotes distribution of data analysis tasks across Cloud and Edge computing environments. However, these existing paradigms fail to provide a detailed account of how technologies such as deep learning can be orchestrated and take advantage of the cloud, edge and mobile edge environments in a holistic manner. In other words, the focus of this Blue Skies piece is to analyze the research challenges involved with developing a new class of holistic distributed deep learning algorithms that are “resource and data aware”, and which are able to account for underlying heterogeneous data and data models, resource (cloud vs. edge vs. mobile edge) models and data availability while executing – trading accuracy for execution time, etc.",

This complexity also prevents solving performance problems (such as server congestion or network congestion), as the main ideas only focus on a small part of the problem, e.g. how to solve a network problem without considering computing resources. This paper introduces the UNITE framework: a set of virtualization layers (computing, networking, and storage) that integrate a complete IoT-edge-cloud architecture and provides a simple interface for end users. UNITE also addresses performance issues by finding holistic solutions that look at the architecture as a whole. In addition, our framework also predicts emerging problems and proactively addresses them in advance before they occur.",

		"abstract": "In the mobile-edge-cloud continuum, a plethora of heterogeneous data sources and computation-capable nodes are available. Such nodes can cooperate to perform a distributed learning task, aided by a learning controller (often located at the network edge). The controller is required to make decisions concerning (i) data selection, i.e., which data sources to use; (ii) model selection, i.e., which machine learning model to adopt, and (iii) matching between the layers of the model and the available physical nodes. All these decisions influence each other, to a significant extent and often in counter-intuitive ways. In this paper, we formulate a problem addressing all of the above aspects and present a solution concept called RightTrain, aiming at making the aforementioned decisions in a joint manner, minimizing energy consumption subject to learning quality and latency constraints. RightTrain leverages an expanded-graph representation of the system and a delay-aware Steiner tree to obtain a provably near-optimal solution while keeping the time complexity low. Specifically, it runs in polynomial time and its decisions exhibit a competitive ratio of 2(1+\\epsilon) , outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by over 50%. Our approach is also validated through a real-world implementation.",

Recognized the unstoppable growth of highly dynamic and heterogeneous edge devices, as well as the pop up of a large set of diverse and ever more demanding services, the selection of those edge resources best meeting service requirements while also matching the expected QoS guarantees is, with no doubt, a challenging task. This paper presents a rank-based model aimed at both evaluating edge nodes’ characteristics and selecting nodes best performing the controller role, whilst simultaneously satisfying the required QoS constraints, coining the so-called Control-as-a-Service concept. To that end, a yet simple prediction strategy, based on Dynamic Branch Prediction is introduced to avoid unnecessary controller exchanges and QoS degradation. In the performed experiments, the proposed method yielded a reduction in the number of exchanges when compared to a solution with no prediction, under different scenarios. Comparing distinct selection strategies, the proposed model presented an improvement in controller availability as well as in relevant controllers’ characteristics, such as battery and memory capacity.",

Unfortunately, traditional centralized key distribution and authentication approaches do not meet the particularities brought by a Fog-to-cloud system due to its distributed nature. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed key management and authentication (DKMA) strategy to make Fog-to-cloud systems as secure as possible.

We discuss how Pegasus and HTCondor (its job scheduler) work together to enable this automation. We use HTCondor to form heterogeneous pools of compute resources and Pegasus to plan the workflow onto these resources and manage containers and data movement for executing workflows in hybrid edge-cloud environments. We then show how Pegasus can be used to evaluate the execution of workflows running on edge only, cloud only, and edge-cloud hybrid environments. Using the Chameleon Cloud testbed to set up and configure an edge-cloud environment, we use Pegasus to benchmark the executions of one synthetic workflow and two production workflows: CASA-Wind and the Ocean Observatories Initiative Orcasound workflow, all of which derive their data from edge devices. We present the performance impact on workflow runs of job and data placement strategies employed by Pegasus when configured to run in the above three execution environments. Results show that the synthetic workflow performs best in an edge only environment, while the CASA - Wind and Orcasound workflows see significant improvements in overall makespan when run in a cloud only environment. The results demonstrate that Pegasus can be used to automate edge-to-cloud science workflows and the workflow provenance data collection capabilities of the Pegasus monitoring daemon enable computer scientists to conduct edge-to-cloud research.",

This new model envisions a continuum of virtual resources between the traditional cloud and the network edge, which is potentially more suitable to meet the heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the supported application domains. Yet, mission-critical applications such as those in manufacturing, automation, or automotive, still rely on communication standards like the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol and 5G to ensure a deterministic network behavior: in this context, virtualization might introduce unacceptable network perturbations. In this paper, we demonstrate that latency-sensitive applications can execute in virtual machines without disruptions to their network operations. We propose a novel approach to support the TSN protocol in virtual machines through a precise clock synchronization method and we implement it in integration with state-of-the-art and highly-efficient network virtualization techniques. Our experimental results show that it is possible to achieve deterministic and ultra-low latency end-to-end communication in the cloud continuum, for example providing a guaranteed sub-millisecond latency between remote virtual machines.",

Centralized message brokers facilitate decoupled device-to-device communication and can transparently scale to handle many millions of messages per second. However, Cloud-based solutions, such as AWS IoT or Azure IoT Hub, are challenged to satisfy the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) and privacy requirements of many modern IoT scenarios. Such scenarios are complex because they are not only distributed, but dynamic, as elements physically move, fail, and/or (dis-)connect to/from the network. Instead, distributed middleware needs to leverage the everincreasing amount of resources at the edge of the network to provide reliable, ultra-low-latency, and privacy-aware message routing. But the heterogeneity and volatility inherent to Edge resources, and the unpredictability of mobile clients, make it extremely challenging to provide resilient coordination mechanisms and guaranteed message delivery. Applying Osmotic Computing principles to message-oriented middleware opens new opportunities for solving these challenges.",

		"abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates a new processing paradigm that incorporates cloud scalability while reducing network latency by utilising resources closer to the network edge. On the one hand, it’s difficult to achieve such flexibility within the edge-to-cloud continuum, which consists of a distributed networked ecosystem of heterogeneous computing resources. IoT traffic dynamics, on the other hand, and the growing need for low-latency services necessitate decreasing reaction time and balancing service location. For cost-effective system administration and operations, fog computing load-balancing will become a cornerstone. Though virtualization attempts to instantaneously balance the load of the overall network, there’s still the possibility of capacity excessive usage or under development. Heavily loaded systems degrade efficiency, while undercharged systems use bandwidth inefficiently. Because of inadequate load distribution, overburdened systems emit additional energy, driving up the cost of coolers as well as adding significantly to the warming of the planet. Throughout most situations, cooling towers consume higher electricity than core IT technology. Despite the benefits of cloud computing as a distributed pool of resources and services, certain new IoT applications are not cloud-ready. Wind farms and smart traffic light systems, for example, have unique characteristics and requirements “(e.g., large-scale, geo-distribution) (e.g., very low and predictable latency)”.

However, stringent latency requirements of emerging applications necessitate optimized selection of storage resources that exhibit smaller delay. Introducing edge resources into distributed storage systems enables data placement closer to its source, but simultaneously increases the complexity of decision-making and orchestration processes for optimal data placement. In this work, we develop mechanisms for storing data across an infrastructure that includes both edge and cloud resources. Our approach focuses on optimizing data integrity, longevity, security, and cost, while leveraging erasure coding when performing the resource allocation. We first present a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming formulation of the storage resource orchestration problem. As the search space for the optimal solution can be vast and the execution time prohibitively large for real size problems, we also propose an innovative multi-agent heuristic approach that uses the rollout, a reinforcement based policy, to balance performance and execution time efficiently. Through various simulation experiments, we evaluate the developed mechanisms and trade-offs involved in our approach. By incorporating data from a multi-cloud provider, we further enhance the validity of the simulations and the conclusions drawn.",

Much of the difficulty in QoS and performance monitoring of IoT applications in an Osmotic computing environment is due to the massive scale and heterogeneity (IoT + Edge + Cloud) of computing environments. To, this end, this work presents an integrated monitoring system for monitoring IoT applications decomposed as microservices and executed in an Osmotic computing environment. A real-world smart parking IoT application is used for an experimental evaluation and for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, we validate the Osmotic monitoring system ability to holistically identify variation in CPU, memory, and network latency of microservices deployed across Cloud and Edge layers.",

		"abstract": "In the past few years, researchers from academia and industry stakeholders suggest adding more computational resources (i.e., storage, networking, and processing) closer to the end-users and IoT domain, respectively, at the edge of the network. Such computation entities perceived as edge devices aim to overcome high-latency issues between the cloud and the IoT domain. Thus, processing IoT data streams closer to the end-users and IoT domain can solve several operational challenges. Since then, a plethora of application-specific IoT systems are introduced, mainly hard-coded, inflexible, and limited extensibility for future changes. Additionally, most IoT systems maintain a centralized design to operate without considering the dynamic nature of edge networks. In this paper, we discuss some of the research issues, challenges, and potential solutions to enable: i) deploying edge functions on edge resources in a distributed manner and ii) deploying and scaling edge applications on-premises of Edge-Cloud infrastructure. Additionally, we discuss in detail the three-tier Edge-Cloud architecture. Finally, we introduce a conceptual framework that aims to enable easy configuration and deployment of edge-based systems on top of heterogeneous edge infrastructure and present our vision within a smart city scenario.",

		"abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) requires a new processing paradigm that inherits the scalability of the cloud while minimizing network latency using resources closer to the network edge. On the one hand, building up such flexibility within the edge-to-cloud continuum consisting of a distributed networked ecosystem of heterogeneous computing resources is challenging. On the other hand, IoT traffic dynamics and the rising demand for low-latency services foster the need for minimizing the response time and a balanced service placement. Load-balancing for fog computing becomes a cornerstone for cost-effective system management and operations. This paper studies two optimization objectives and formulates a decentralized load-balancing problem for IoT service placement: (global) IoT workload balance and (local) quality of service (QoS), in terms of minimizing the cost of deadline violation, service deployment, and unhosted services. The proposed solution, EPOS Fog, introduces a decentralized multi-agent system for collective learning that utilizes edge-to-cloud nodes to jointly balance the input workload across the network and minimize the costs involved in service execution. The agents locally generate possible assignments of requests to resources and then cooperatively select an assignment such that their combination maximizes edge utilization while minimizes service execution cost. Extensive experimental evaluation with realistic Google cluster workloads on various networks demonstrates the superior performance of EPOS Fog in terms of workload balance and QoS, compared to approaches such as First Fit and exclusively Cloud-based. The results confirm that EPOS Fog reduces service execution delay up to 25% and the load-balance of network nodes up to 90%. The findings also demonstrate how distributed computational resources on the edge can be utilized more cost-effectively by harvesting collective intelligence.",

		"abstract": "A vast and growing number of IoT applications connect physical devices, such as scientific instruments, technical equipment, machines, and cameras, across heterogenous infrastructure from the edge to the cloud to provide responsive, intelligent services while complying with privacy and security requirements. However, the integration of heterogeneous IoT, edge, and cloud technologies and the design of end-to-end applications that seamlessly work across multiple layers and types of infrastructures is challenging. A significant issue is resource management and the need to ensure that the right type and scale of resources is allocated on every layer to fulfill the application's processing needs. As edge and cloud layers are increasingly tightly integrated, imbalanced resource allocations and sub-optimally placed tasks can quickly deteriorate the overall system performance. This paper proposes an emulation approach for the investigation of task placements across the edge-to-cloud continuum. We demonstrate that emulation can address the complexity and many degrees-of-freedom of the problem, allowing us to investigate essential deployment patterns and trade-offs. We evaluate our approach using a machine learning-based workload, demonstrating the validity by comparing emulation and real-world experiments. Further, we show that the right task placement strategy has a significant impact on performance - in our experiments, between 5% and 65% depending on the scenario.",

This paper proposes a novel IoT-oriented middleware that i) considers and coordinates together different aspects of QoS monitoring, control, and management for different kinds of virtualized resources (from networking to processing) in a holistic way, and ii) specifically targets deployment environments where edge cloud resources are employed to enable the Serverless paradigm in the cloud continuum. The reported experimental results show how it is possible to achieve the desired QoS differentiation by coordinating heterogeneous mechanisms and technologies already available in the market. This demonstrates the feasibility of effective QoS-aware management of virtualized resources in the cloud-to-things continuum when considering a Serverless provisioning scenario, which is completely original in the related literature to the best of our knowledge.",

		"abstract": "A combination of distributed multi-tenant infrastructures, such as public Clouds and on-premises installations belonging to different organisations, are frequently used for scientific research because of the high computational requirements involved. Although resource sharing maximises their usage, it typically causes undesirable effects such as the noisy neighbour, producing unpredictable variations of the infrastructure computing capabilities. These fluctuations affect execution efficiency, even of loosely coupled applications, such as many Monte Carlo based simulation programs. This highlights the need of a service capable to handle workload distribution across multiple infrastructures to mitigate these unpredictable performance fluctuations. With this aim, this work introduces TaScaaS, a highly scalable and completely serverless service deployed on AWS to distribute loosely coupled jobs among several computing infrastructures, and load balance them using a completely asynchronous approach to cope with the performance fluctuations with minimum impact in the execution time. We demonstrate how TaScaaS is not only capable of handling these fluctuations efficiently, achieving reduction in execution times up to 45% in our experiments, but also split the jobs to be computed to meet the user-defined execution time.",

		"abstract": "Pervasive computing promotes the installation of connected devices in our living spaces in order to provide services. Two major developments have gained significant momentum recently: an advanced use of edge resources and the integration of machine learning techniques for engineering applications. This evolution raises major challenges, in particular related to the appropriate distribution of computing elements along an edge-to-cloud continuum. About this, Federated Learning has been recently proposed for distributed model training in the edge. The principle of this approach is to aggregate models learned on distributed clients in order to obtain a new, more general model. The resulting model is then redistributed to clients for further training. To date, the most popular federated learning algorithm uses coordinate-wise averaging of the model parameters for aggregation. However, it has been shown that this method is not adapted in heterogeneous environments where data is not identically and independently distributed (non-iid). This corresponds directly to some pervasive computing scenarios where heterogeneity of devices and users challenges machine learning with the double objective of generalization and personalization. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation algorithm, termed FedDist, which is able to modify its model architecture (here, deep neural network) by identifying dissimilarities between specific neurons amongst the clients. This permits to account for clients' specificity without impairing generalization. Furthermore, we define a complete method to evaluate federated learning in a realistic way taking generalization and personalization into account. Using this method, FedDist is extensively tested and compared with three state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on the pervasive domain of Human Activity Recognition with smartphones.",

		"abstract": "Accelerator virtualization offers several advantages in the context of cloud-edge computing. Relatively weak user devices can enhance performance when running workloads by accessing virtualized accelerators available on other resources in the cloud-edge continuum. However, cloud-edge systems are heterogeneous, often leading to compatibility issues arising from various hardware and software stacks present in the system. One mechanism to alleviate this issue is using containers for deploying workloads. Containers isolate applications and their dependencies and store them as images that can run on any device. In addition, user devices may move during the course of application execution, and thus mechanisms such as container migration are required to move running workloads from one resource to another in the network. Furthermore, an optimal destination will need to be determined when migrating between virtual accelerators. Scheduling and placement strategies are incorporated to choose the best possible location depending on the workload requirements. This paper presents AVEC, a framework for accelerator virtualization in cloud-edge computing. The AVEC framework enables the offloading of deep learning workloads for inference from weak user devices to computationally more powerful devices in a cloud-edge network. AVEC incorporates a mechanism that efficiently manages and schedules the virtualization of accelerators. It also supports migration between accelerators to enable stateless container migration. The experimental analysis highlights that AVEC can achieve up to 7x speedup by offloading applications to remote resources. Furthermore, AVEC features a low migration downtime that is less than 5 seconds.",

We propose a new view of the Cloud-Edge continuum, where infrastructure providers lease tailored portions of the infrastructure, determined by taking into account the hardware and QoS requirements as well as the sustainability goals expressed by application operators.

		"abstract": "The extreme service requirements posed by 6G are particularly challenging in environments where terrestrial infrastructure is not continuously available, whereby connectivity complements offered by non-terrestrial networks are an appealing option. The 5G standardisation process currently carried out within 3GPP has instead proven the need for non-terrestrial networks and their seamless integration into terrestrial networks, so as to enable several use-cases in the context of un(der) served scenarios and eventually achieve the largely advertised concept of “connecting the unconnected”. In such a context, the data connectivity model is not exclusively based on pushing video contents to demanding users like in typical satellite business, but is embracing more attractive use-cases for the entire 6G ecosystem, i.e. ranging from device manufacturers to cloud/service providers through mobile/satellite operators. In particular, effective data distribution over multiple links, AI-driven network management, routing and resource allocation, as well as cloud-continuum in heterogeneous networks are key objectives for paving the way towards NTN-inclusive 6G systems. Behind the many potentials that such an ambitious network concept offers, important research challenges emerge, hence motivating a multi-folded analysis, including network architecture, protocol, and algorithm optimisations. Some of the most interesting research directions are addressed in this paper, in order to shed some lights into the main elements characterising the considered technology problems and delve into the corresponding solution space. Additionally, an initial evaluation of AI-driven network management and routing approaches is provided.",

		"abstract": "Research trends are pushing artificial intelligence (AI) across the Internet of Things (IoT)–edge–fog–cloud continuum to enable effective data analytics, decision making, as well as the efficient use of resources for QoS targets. Approaches for collective adaptive systems (CASs) engineering, such as aggregate computing, provide declarative programming models and tools for dealing with the uncertainty and the complexity that may arise from scale, heterogeneity, and dynamicity. Crucially, aggregate computing architecture allows for “pulverization”: applications can be decomposed into many deployable micromodules that can be spread across the ICT infrastructure, thus allowing multiple potential deployment configurations for the same application logic. This article studies the deployment architecture of aggregate-based edge services and its implications in terms of performance and cost. The goal is to provide methodological guidelines and a model-based toolchain for the generation and simulation-based evaluation of potential deployments. First, we address this subject methodologically by proposing an approach based on deployment code generators and a simulation phase whose obtained solutions are assessed with respect to their performance and costs. We then tailor this approach to aggregate computing applications deployed onto an IoT–edge–fog–cloud infrastructure, and we develop a corresponding toolchain based on Protelis and EdgeCloudSim. Finally, we evaluate the approach and tools through a case study of edge multimedia streaming, where the edge ecosystem exhibits intelligence by self-organizing into clusters to promote load balancing in large-scale dynamic settings.",

		"abstract": "The Cloud Continuum concept proposes integrating Edge, Central Clouds as well as constrained, dynamic and unreliable Far-Edge resources (terminals, IoT) owned by users and different providers and exposing them to services uniformly. The ETSI NFV MANO framework assumes almost static NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) and has no business interfaces nor mechanisms for the dynamic adding or removing data centres. It is also not able to cope with constrained and unreliable resources. The paper presents a modification of the MANO framework to cope with the mentioned issues. In the described concept, all resources are exposed to the orchestrators via the Resource Layer, which also provides business interfaces to different infrastructure providers and improves exposed resources’ reliability by hiding infrastructure dynamicity to a certain extent. The idea also contributes to orchestration scalability by allowing multiple orchestrators atop the same resource pool.",

		"abstract": "With the advent of massively distributed applications such as those required by the IoT-to-Edge-to-Cloud compute continuum (i.e., automotive, smart agriculture, smart manufacturing, and more), real-time communication mechanisms allowing physically distributed nodes to seamlessly communicate as if they were running on the same host acquired noteworthy importance. To this end, the synchronous inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism provided by the QNX operating system (OS) is a promising candidate, as it allows using the application programming interface for communicating both on a single- and multi-node setting. Furthermore, it provides priority and partition inheritance mechanisms to improve predictability when working with the Adaptive Partitioning Scheduler (APS), a reservationbased scheduler provided by the QNX OS. This paper explores the behavior of the QNX synchronous message-passing (SyncMP) IPC with an extensive set of experiments, using them to formalize its behavior and model it from a real-time perspective. Then, it provides a response-time analysis for client-server applications based on the QNX SyncMP building upon self-suspending task theory. Finally, we evaluate the analysis on an application based on the WATERS 2019 Challenge by Bosch.",

		"abstract": "Future healthcare services will extensively exploit wireless telehealth solutions in various healthcare use cases from preventive home monitoring to highly demanding real-time scenarios, such as monitoring an emergency patient's vital functions in an ambulance or ICU unit. Reliable real-time communications and computing are needed to enable these highly critical health services. However, the majority of current telehealth use cases are cloud - based, which poses a challenge to provide sufficient Quality of Service (QoS). The traditional centralized cloud infrastructure cannot meet the latency and reliability requirements due to long and unreliable communication routes. Therefore, the most advanced cloud solutions integrate edge computing as an integral part of the computational architecture to bring a part of the computational infrastructure to the proximity of the data sources and end-nodes, thus constituting an edge-cloud continuum. This continuum is capable of serving applications with real-time requirements. However, since edge computing capacity is a limited resource, solutions are needed for deciding which tasks should be run on edge and which at the data center. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based solution to prioritize ultra-low-latency tasks for running on the edge to meet their strict delay requirements while leaving other tasks to be executed at remote servers. Our proposed solution in comparison to the baseline has a significantly lower dropping rate and outperforms fixed - interval scheduling solutions in terms of resource efficiency.",

Each smart building is distinct in terms of requirements and characteristics. Hence, developing smart buildings to achieve reliability and real-time environmental adaption is a challenging task.

The physical building's real-time data is gathered from a distributed set of IoT sensors and cameras together with the facility management system's APIs into its digital twin. Then, the data is processed across both edge devices and in the cloud environment using machine learning models to generate insights required to manage daily operation of its physical components holistically.

The DCCS helps increase flexibility with improved performance of hybrid IoT-Edge-Cloud infrastructures. In contrast, representation learning extracts the features (meaningful information) and underlying explanatory factors from the given datasets. With these benefits, using ReL for DCCS to improve its performance by monitoring the devices will increase the utilization efficiency, zero downtime, etc. In this context, this paper discusses the promising role of ReL for DCCS in terms of different aspects, including device condition monitoring, predictions, management of the systems, etc. This paper also provides a list of ReL algorithms and their pitfalls which helps DCCS by considering various constraints. In addition, this paper list different challenges imposed on ReL to analyze DCCS data.

		"abstract": "Workflow offloading in the edge-to-cloud continuum copes with an extended calculation network among edge devices and cloud platforms. With the growing significance of edge and cloud technologies, workflow offloading among these environments has been investigated in recent years. However, the dynamics of offloading optimization objectives, i.e., latency, resource utilization rate, and energy consumption among the edge and cloud sides, have hardly been researched. Consequently, the Quality of Service(QoS) and offloading performance also experience uncertain deviation. In this work, we propose a multi-objective robust offloading algorithm to address this issue, dealing with dynamics and multi-objective optimization. The workflow request model in this work is modeled as Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG). An LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence neural network learns the offloading policy. We then conduct comprehensive implementations to validate the robustness of our algorithm. As a result, our algorithm achieves better offloading performance regarding each objective and faster adaptation to newly changed environments than fine-tuned typical single-objective RL-based offloading methods. © 2022 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Serverless computing has been establishing itself as a compelling paradigm for the development and of modern cloud-native applications. Serverless represents the next step in the evolution of cloud programming models, services and platforms, which is especially appealing due to its low management overhead, easy deployment, scale-to-zero and the promise of optimized costs. Recently, due to the advantages it offers, the serverless paradigm has been growing beyond traditional clouds, making its way to the Edge. The natural evolutionary step for serverless computing is to unify the Edge and the Cloud into what we refer to as Edge-Cloud Continuum. In this paper, we outline our vision of the Serverless Computing Fabric (SCF) for the Edge-Cloud continuum. We introduce the reference architecture for the SCF and show how it unlocks the full potential of the Edge-Cloud continuum. We also discuss main opportunities and challenges, which need to be overcome in order to achieve the vision of the Serverless Computing Fabric. Finally, we introduce key design principles together with core enabling runtime mechanisms, which are intended to serve as a research road map towards the Serverless Computing Fabric for Edge-Cloud continuum. © 2022 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, Serverless computing is emerging as one of the most used Cloud services. In particular, the Function as Service (FaaS) is bringing to Cloud consumers, developers, and devops many advantages in terms of service costs, speed of development, and ease of deployment. In fact, it stands to be a key technology for enabling the Cloud-Edge Continuum. Regardless of these features, it is still not possible to build FaaS native applications without a Cloud broker that coordinates the functions. Therefore, FaaS usage is limited to very simple and specific jobs. In this work, we brush up on the concept of Scientific Workflow using the FaaS paradigm, in order to realize full Native Serverless Workflows-based applications. We define a custom Workflow Manifest DSL used to describe function interactions, then we describe the implementation of an agent able to deploy architecture-independent functions and coordinate them according to the Manifest. Finally, federating the Cloud-Fog-Edge tiers in a single Continuum environment, we allow functions to take advantage of the Continuum tier's characteristics where they are deployed.

		"abstract": "5G and Edge computing are two technologies set to impose a paradigm shift from today's traditional networking solutions. In particular, transport networks, which connect distinct computing infrastructures, must guarantee a wide range of performance requirements from coexisting network services. 5G network slicing enables such capability by providing the flexibility to support multiple and isolated virtual networks over the same and shared infrastructure. This paper introduces the GST And Network Slice Operator (GANSO) framework for automating the creation of network slices over SDN architectures, focusing on transport networks interconnecting Edge data centers. To characterise the type of network slice to be deployed, it uses Generic network Slice Templates (GSTs). Initially, five GST attributes are implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype, namely through configurable User Data Access and Rate Limit parameters. It is then validated in a scenario considering the instantiation of network slices over the transport network for different virtual applications hosted across the edge-to-cloud continuum. © 2020 IEEE.",

Users should be able to achieve their goals seamlessly in different environments, and IoT systems should be able to cope with dynamic changes. Several approaches have been proposed to enable the automated formation, enactment, and self-adaptation of goal-driven IoT systems. However, they do not address deployment issues. In this paper, we propose a goal-driven approach for deploying self-adaptive IoT systems in the Edge-Cloud continuum. Our approach supports the systems to cope with the dynamicity and uncertainty of the environment including changes in their deployment topologies, i.e., the deployment nodes and their interconnections. We describe the architecture and processes of the approach and the simulations that we conducted to validate its feasibility. The results of the simulations show that the approach scales well when generating and adapting the deployment topologies of goal-driven IoT systems in smart homes and smart buildings. © 2020 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "In beyond-5G networks, detailed end-to-end monitoring of specific application traffic will be required along with the access-backhaul-cloud continuum to enable low latency service due to local edge steering. Current monitoring solutions are confined to specific network segments. In-band network telemetry (INT) technologies for software defined network (SDN) programmable data planes based on the P4 language are effective in the backhaul network segment, although limited to inter-switch latency; therefore, link latencies including wireless and optical segments are excluded from INT monitoring. Moreover, information such as user equipment (UE) geolocation would allow detailed mobility monitoring and improved cloud-edge steering policies. However, the synchronization between latency and location information, typically provided by different platforms, is hard to achieve with current monitoring systems. In this paper, P4-based INT is proposed to be thoroughly extended involving UE. The INT mechanism is designed to provide synchronized and accurate end-to-end latency and geolocation information, enabling decentralized steering policies, i.e., involving UE and selected switches, without SDN controller intervention. The proposal also includes an artificial-intelligence-assisted forecast system able to predict latency and geolocation in advance and trigger faster edge steering. © 2009-2012 OSA.",

		"abstract": "Developing data-driven applications requires developers and service providers to orchestrate data-to-discovery pipelines across distributed data sources and computing units. Realizing such pipelines poses two major challenges: programming analytics that reacts at runtime to unforeseen events, and adaptation of the resources and computing paths between the edge and the cloud. While these concerns are interdependent, they must be separated during the design process of the application and the deployment operations of the infrastructure. This work proposes a system stack for the adaptation of distributed analytics across the computing continuum. We implemented this software stack to evaluate its ability to continually balance the computation or data movement's cost with the value of operations to the application objectives. Using a disaster response application, we observe that the system can select appropriate configurations while managing trade-offs between user-defined constraints, quality of results, and resource utilization. The evaluation shows that our model is able to adapt to variations in the data input size, bandwidth, and CPU capacities with minimal deadline violations (close to 10%).

		"abstract": "User-facing services are now evolving towards the microservice architecture where a service is built by connecting multiple microservice stages. While an entire service is heavy, the microservice architecture shows the opportunity to only offload some microservice stages to the edge devices that are close to the end users. However, emerging techniques often result in the violation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) of microservice-based services in cloud-edge continuum, as they do not consider the communication overhead or the resource contention between microservices.We propose Nautilus, a runtime system that effectively deploys microservice-based user-facing services in cloud-edge continuum. It ensures the QoS of microservice-based user-facing services while minimizing the required computational resources. Nautilus is comprised of a communication-aware microservice mapper, a contention-aware resource manager and a load-aware microservice scheduler. The mapper divides the microservice graph into multiple partitions based on the communication overhead and maps the partitions to the nodes. On each node, the resource manager determines the optimal resource allocation for its microservices based on reinforcement learning that may capture the complex contention behaviors. The microservice scheduler monitors the QoS of the entire service, and migrates microservices from busy nodes to idle ones at runtime. Our experimental results show that Nautilus reduces the computational resource usage by 23.9% and the network bandwidth usage by 53.4%, while achieving the required 99%-ile latency. © 2021 IEEE.",

To facilitate the development and operations of gateways, we implement offloading directly as part of the IoT rapid prototyping process embedded in the software stack, based on Node-RED.

		"abstract": "In recent years, the rapid growth of new Cloud technologies acted as an enabling factor for the adoption of microservices based architecture that leverages container virtualization in order to build modular and robust systems. As the number of containers running on hosts increases, it becomes essential to have tools to manage them in a simple, straightforward manner and with a high level of abstraction. Osmotic Computing is an emerging research field that studies the migration, deployment and optimization of microservices from the Cloud to Fog, Edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in order to achieve Osmotic Computing environments, connectivity issues have to be addressed. This paper investigates these connectivity issues leveraging different network overlays. In particular, we analyze the performance of four network overlays that are OVN, Calico, Weave, and Flannel. Our results give a concrete overview in terms of overhead and performances for each proposed overlay solution, helping us to understand which the best overlay solution is. Specifically, we deployed CoAP and FTP microservices which helped us to carry out these benchmarks and collect the results in terms of transfer times. © 2018 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Databases as software components may be used to serve a variety of smart applications. Currently, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies are used in the course of projects such as the Horizon 2020 EU-Korea DECENTER project in order to implement four smart applications in the domains of Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Construction and Robot Logistics. In these smart applications the Big Data pipeline starts from various sensor and video streams to which AI and feature extraction methods are applied. The resulting information is stored in database containers, which have to be placed on Edge, Fog or Cloud infrastructures. The placement decision depends on complex application requirements, including Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Information that must be considered when making placement decisions includes the expected workload, the list of candidate infrastructures, geolocation, connectivity and similar. Software engineers currently perform such decisions manually, which usually leads to QoS threshold violations. This paper aims to automate the process of making such decisions. Therefore, the goals of this paper are to: (1) develop a decision making method for database container placement; (2) formally verify each placement decision and provide probability assurances to the software engineer for high QoS; and (3) design and implement a new architecture that automates the whole process. A new optimisation method is introduced, which is based on the theory and practice of stochastic Markov Decision Processes (MDP). It uses as input monitoring data from the container runtime, the expected workload and user-related metrics in order to automatically construct a probabilistic finite automaton. The generated automaton is used for both automated decision making and placement success verification. The method is implemented in Java. It also uses the PRISM model-checking tool. Kubernetes is used in order to automate the whole process when orchestrating database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures. Experiments are performed for NoSQL Cassandra database containers for three representative workloads of 50000 (workload 1), 200000 (workload 2) and 500000 (workload 3) CRUD database operations. Five computing infrastructures serve as candidates for database container placement. The new MDP-based method is compared with the widely used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The obtained results are used to analyse container placement decisions. When using the new MDP based method there were no QoS violations in any of the placement cases, while when using the AHP based method the placement results in some QoS threshold violations in all workload cases. Due to its properties, the new MDP method is particularly suitable for implementation. The paper also describes a multi-tier distributed computing system that uses multi-level (infrastructure, container, application) monitoring metrics and Kubernetes in order to orchestrate database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud nodes. This architecture demonstrates fully automated decision making and high QoS container operation. © 2019 IEEE",

		"abstract": "Edge computing takes computation away from the Cloud closer to the physical world. Therefore, it reduces the cost of communication bandwidth between IoT devices and the Cloud. However, Edge computing imposes certain limitations in computation power because due to poor hardware capacity of the devices. This restriction may significantly affect the performance of the deployed applications, especially Smart City applications. This limitations also could be aggravated by unpredictable human behaviors wich will easily make the Edge computation node overloaded. Osmotic computing is a new IoT application programming paradigm that provides an opportunity to balance the workload between Edge and Cloud therefore to overcome the load imbalance problem of Smart City applications. To this end, we propose an Osmotic Execution Framework that leverages state-of-the-art microservices techniques to deploy and execute a Smart City application in a distributed environment including Edge and Cloud. Finally, we evaluate load balancing through latency time analysis of our framework with a real-world smart parking application. © 2018 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Edge computing has gained momentum in recent years, as complementary to cloud computing, for supporting applications (e.g., industrial control systems) that require time-critical communication guarantees. While edge computing can provide immediate analysis of streaming data from Internet of Things devices, those devices lack computing capabilities to guarantee reasonable performance for time-critical applications. To alleviate this critical problem, the prevalent trend is to offload these data analytic tasks from the edge devices to the cloud. However, existing offloading approaches are static in nature as they are unable to adapt varying workload and network conditions. To handle these issues, we present a novel distributed and quality of services based multilevel queue traffic scheduling system that can undertake semiautomatic bandwidth slicing to process time-critical incoming traffic in the edge-cloud environments. Our developed system shows a great enhancement in latency and throughput as well as reduction in energy consumption for edge-cloud environments. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Sensor data is of crucial importance in many IoT scenarios. It is used for online monitoring as well as long term data analytics, enabling countless use cases from damage prevention to predictive maintenance. Multivariate sensor time series data is acquired and initially stored close to the sensor, at the edge. It is also beneficial to summarize this data in windowed aggregations at different resolutions. A subset of the resulting aggregation hierarchy is typically sent to a cloud infrastructure, often via intermittent or low bandwidth connections. Consequently, different views on the data exist on different nodes in the edge-To-cloud continuum. However, when querying this data, users are interested in a fast response and a complete, unified view on the data, regardless of which part in the infrastructure continuum they send the query to and where the data is physically stored. In this paper, we present a loosely coupled approach that enables fast range queries on a distributed and hierarchical sensor database. Our system only assumes the possibility of fast local range queries on a hierarchical sensor database. It does not require any shared state between nodes and thus degrades gracefully in case certain parts of the hierarchy are unreachable. We show that our system is suitable for driving interactive data exploration sessions on terabytes of data while unifying the different views on the data. Thus, our system can improve the data analysis experience in many geo-distributed scenarios. © 2022 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "In the Smart Cities context, a plethora of Middle-ware Platforms had been proposed to support applications execution and data processing. Despite all the progress already made, the vast majority of solutions have not met the requirements of Applications' Runtime, Development, and Deployment when related to Scalability. Some studies point out that just 1 of 97 (1%) reported platforms reach this all this set of requirements at same time. This small number of platforms may be explained by some reasons: i) Big Data: The huge amount of processed and stored data with various data sources and data types, ii) Multi-domains: many domains involved (Economy, Traffic, Health, Security, Agronomy, etc.), iii) Multiple processing methods like Data Flow, Batch Processing, Services, and Microservices, and 4) High Distributed Degree: The use of multiple IoT and BigData tools combined with execution at various computational levels (Edge, Fog, Cloud) leads applications to present a high level of distribution. Aware of those great challenges, we propose Sapparchi, an integrated architectural model for Smart Cities applications that defines multi-processing levels (Edge, Fog, and Cloud). Also, it presents the Sapparchi middleware platform for developing, deploying, and running applications in the smart city environment with an osmotic multi-processing approach that scales applications from Cloud to Edge. Finally, an experimental evaluation exposes the main advantages of adopting Sapparchi. © 2022 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Edge-driven software applications often deployed as online services in the cloud-to-edge continuum lack significant protection for services and infrastructures against emerging cyberattacks. Very-Short Intermittent Distributed Denial of Service (VSI-DDoS) attack is one of the biggest factors for diminishing the Quality of Services (QoS) and Quality of Experiences (QoE) for users on edge. Unlike conventional DDoS attacks, these attacks live for a very short time (on the order of a few milliseconds) in the traffic to deceive users with a legitimate service experience. To provide protection, we propose a novel and efficient approach for detecting VSI-DDoS attacks using reinforced transformer learning that mitigates the tail latency and service availability problems in edge clouds. In the presence of attacks, the users' demand for availing ultra-low latency and high throughput services deployed on the edge, can never be met. Moreover, these attacks send very-short intermittent requests towards the target services that enforce longer delays in users' responses. The assimilation of transformer with deep reinforcement learning accelerates detection performance under adverse conditions by adapting the dynamic and the most discernible patterns of attacks (e.g., multiplicative temporal dependency, attack dynamism). The extensive experiments with testbed and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable, effective, and efficient for detecting VSI-DDoS attacks in edge clouds. The results outperform state-of-the-art methods with 0.9%-3.2% higher accuracy in both datasets. © 2013 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "The rapid spread of the Internet of Things (IoT), with billions of connected devices, has generated huge amounts of data and asks for decentralized solutions for machine learning. However, performing complex learning tasks at the edge of the network is posing great challenges in terms of efficient management of data storing, transfer, and analysis. For these reasons, a lot of research and development effort is devoted to adapt different machine learning algorithms so that cooperative training and inference on local data occur directly at the edge of the network. This scenario represents a major challenge today due to the limited capacities of edge devices, the different technologies with which these devices work and communicate, and the lack of common software stacks to easily manage them. In this paper, we analyze distributed machine learning algorithms and how they should be adapted to run at the network edge and, if needed, cooperate with the cloud to ensure low latency, energy savings, privacy preserving and scalability. In particular, we briefly discuss how the main machine learning algorithms have been adapted to work in traditional distributed platforms (such as clusters, clouds, and HPC systems) and the main research work that has led these algorithms to run on resource-constrained edge devices. Then, a layered approach is introduced and discussed for adapting machine learning algorithms on edge-cloud architectures. Finally, we conclude the paper by describing some application scenarios that can benefit from this approach. © 2022 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "In the last years, MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) paradigm is attracting the attention from the community, extrapolating the DevOps (Development and Operations) paradigm to the artificial intelligence (AI) development life-cycle. In this area, some challenges must be addressed to successfully deliver solutions since there are specific nuances when dealing with AI operationalization such as the model packaging or monitoring. Fortunately, interesting and helpful approaches, both from the research community and industry have emerged. However, further research is still necessary to fulfil key gaps. This paper presents a tool, MLPacker, for addressing some of them. Concretely, this tool provides mechanisms to package and deploy analytic pipelines both in REST APIs and in streaming mode. In addition, the analytic pipelines can be deployed atomically (i.e., the whole pipeline in the same machine) or in a distributed fashion (i.e., deploying each stage of the pipeline in distinct machines). In this way, users can take advantage from the cloud continuum paradigm considering edge-fog-cloud computing layers. Finally, the tool is decoupled from the training stage to avoid data scientists the integration of blocks of code in their experiments for the operationalization. Besides the package mode (REST API or streaming), the tool can be configured to perform the deployments in local or in remote machines and by using or not containers. For this aim, this paper describes the gaps this tool addresses, the detailed components and flows supported, as well as an scenario with three different case studies to better explain the research conducted. © 2022 University of Split, FESB.",

Not only it has to be integrated with existing cloud-based systems, but also cope with both operational and analytical workloads and be compatible with a variety of SQL and NoSQL database management systems. We address these challenges with AIDA-DB, a polyglot data management architecture for the edge and cloud continuum. It leverages recent development in distributed transaction processing for a reliable mutable state in operational workloads, with a flexible synchronization mechanism for efficient data collection in cloud-based analytical workloads. © 2022 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "Rising aggressive virus pandemics urge to conduct studies on dependability and security of modern computing systems to secure autonomous and continuous operations of healthcare systems. In that regard, we propose to quantify dependability and security measures of an Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) infrastructure relied on an integrated physical architecture of cloud/fog/edge (CFE) computing paradigms in this article. We propose a reliability/availability quantification methodology for the IoMT infrastructure using a hierarchical model of three levels: 1) fault tree (FT) of overall IoMT infrastructure consisting of CFE member systems; 2) FT of subsystems within CFE member systems; and 3) continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models of components/devices in the subsystems. We incorporate a number of failure modes for the underlying subsystems, including Mandel-bug related failures and non-Mandel bugs related failure, as well as failures due to cyber-security attacks on software subsystems. Five case-studies of configuration alternation and four operational scenarios of the IoMT infrastructure are considered to comprehend the dependability characteristics of the IoMT physical infrastructure. The metrics of interest include reliability over time, steady state availability (SSA), sensitivity of SSA wrt. selected mean time to failure-equivalent (MTTFeq) and mean time to recovery-equivalent (MTTReq), and sensitivity of SSA wrt. frequencies of cyber-security attacks on software subsystems. The analysis results help comprehend operational behaviors and properties of a typical IoMT infrastructure. The findings of this study can improve the design and implementation of real-world IoMT infrastructures consisting of cloud, fog, and edge computing paradigms. © 2014 IEEE.",

It is particularly suitable in the edge-to-cloud continuum to build robust solutions and allow a new view on these types of applications. Moreover, we use this approach in a production environment.

		"abstract": "The proliferation of smart sensing and computing devices, capable of collecting a vast amount of data, has made the gathering of the necessary vehicular traffic data relatively easy. However, the analysis of these big data sets requires computational resources, which are currently provided by the Cloud Data Centers. Nevertheless, the Cloud Data Centers can have unacceptably high latency for vehicular analysis applications with strict time requirements. The recent introduction of the Edge computing paradigm, as an extension of the Cloud services, has partially moved the processing of big data closer to the data sources, thus addressing this issue. Unfortunately, this unlocked multiple challenges related to resources management. Therefore, we present a model for scheduling of vehicular traffic analysis applications with partial task offloading across the Cloud -/- Edge continuum. The approach represents the traffic applications as a set of interconnected tasks composed into a workflow that can be partially offloaded to the Edge. We evaluated the approach through a simulated Cloud - Edge environment that considers two representative vehicular traffic applications with a focus on video stream analysis. Our results show that the presented approach reduces the application response time up to eight times while improving energy efficiency by a factor of four. © 2020 IEEE.",

However, diverse abstractions and infrastructures for managing resources and tasks across the edge-to-cloud scenario are required. We propose Pilot-Edge as a common abstraction for resource management across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Pilot-Edge is based on the pilot abstraction, which decouples resource and workload management, and provides a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) interface for application-level tasks. The abstraction allows applications to encapsulate common functions in high-level tasks that can then be configured and deployed across the continuum. We characterize Pilot-Edge on geographically distributed infrastructures using machine learning workloads (e. g., k-means and auto-encoders). Our experiments demonstrate how Pilot-Edge manages distributed resources and allows applications to evaluate task placement based on multiple factors (e. g., model complexities, throughput, and latency). © 2021 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a sweeping revolution in the healthcare industry, with IoT quickly establishing itself as a critical part of modern healthcare. The rapid proliferation of such IoMT devices can bring limitations to the current Cloud-IoT centric infrastructures which are not designed to handle huge volumes and velocity of data generated. To address this problem, it is necessary to revisit the network architecture, pushing some data, processing and services directly on the edge nodes of the network where the data originates, away from the centralized Cloud. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) aims to provide a new paradigm for the integration between a centralized Cloud layer and Edge/IoT layers. The deployment and migration strategies through the Cloud and Edge layers depend on the infrastructures and applications requirements. This scientific work promotes the basic principles behind the OC paradigm and proposes a closed-loop OC flow model applied to a gamified cognitive rehabilitation use case. Moreover, the use case introduces the development of a customized virtual reality system based on a serious game which allows the patient to carry out physical and cognitive rehabilitation therapies using a natural user interface based on Microsoft Kinect. © 2018 IEEE.",

		"abstract": "To implement machine learning algorithms and other useful algorithms in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), new computing approaches are needed to prevent costs associated with having to install state of the art edge analytic devices. A suitable approach may include collaborative edge computing using available, resource-constrained IoT edge analytic hardware. In this paper, collaborative computing method is used to construct a popular and very useful waveform for IoT analytics, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). GMM parameters are learned in the cloud, but the GMMs are constructed at the IIoT edge layer. GMMs are constructed using C28x, a ubiquitous, low-cost, embedded digital signal processor (DSP) that is widely available in many pre-existing IIoT infrastructures and in many edge analytic devices. Several GMMs including 2-GMM and 3-GMMs are constructed using the C28x DSP and Embedded C to show that GMM designs could be achieved in form of an osmotic microservice from the IIoT edge to the IIoT fog layer. Designed GMMs are evaluated using their differential and zero-crossings and are found to satisfy important waveform design criteria. At the fog layer, constructed GMMs are then applied for novelty detection, an IIoT cybersecurity and fault-monitoring application and are found to be able to detect anomalies in IIoT machine data using Hampel identifier, 3-Sigma rule, and the Boxplot rule. The osmotic collaborative computing method advocated in this paper will be crucial in ensuring the possibility of shifting many complex applications such as novelty detection and other machine learning based cybersecurity applications to edges of large scale IoT networks using low-cost widely available DSPs. © 2018 IEEE.",

Specifically, it allows dealing with the transparent deployment of distributed services on a combination of Cloud and Edge (or simply Osmotic) nodes, guaranteeing data proximity to end users and IoT devices. In order to optimize applications, software components called Micro ELements (MELs) have to be properly deployed and moved between the Cloud the Edge and the IoT. In this paper, we focus on the MEL addressability problem, intended as the capacity to communicate with the same MEL without caring about its possible migration in different nodes of the same Osmotic Infrastructure. Specifically, we discuss an Osmotic Computing Enabled Domain Name System (OCE-DNS) integrated with the Osmotic Infrastructure, used to address the MELs and to hide their migrations through the use of a dynamic and low latency Resource Record (RR) database containing the real position of the MELs. Specifically, a system prototype developed using a CoreDNS server and an Etcd cluster is discussed and tested showing a good performance in terms of response time and scalability. In order to validate our work, we tested the OCE-DNS in an Osmotic smart city.",

		"abstract": "As the next generation of diverse workloads like autonomous driving and augmented/virtual reality evolves, computation is shifting from cloud-based services to the edge, leading to the emergence of a cloud-edge compute continuum. This continuum promises a wide spectrum of deployment opportunities for workloads that can leverage the strengths of cloud (scalable infrastructure, high reliability) and edge (energy efficient, low latencies). Despite its promises, the continuum has only been studied in silos of various computing models, thus lacking strong end-to-end theoretical and engineering foundations for computing and resource management across the continuum. Consequently, devel-opers resort to ad hoc approaches to reason about performance and resource utilization of workloads in the continuum. In this work, we conduct a first-of-its-kind systematic study of various computing models, identify salient properties, and make a case to unify them under a compute continuum reference architecture. This architecture provides an end-to-end analysis framework for developers to reason about resource management, workload distribution, and performance analysis. We demonstrate the utility of the reference architecture by analyzing two popular continuum workloads, deep learning and industrial IoT. We have developed an accompanying deployment and benchmarking framework and first-order analytical model for quantitative reasoning of continuum workloads. The framework is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum.",

Cognitive Cloud Continuum, i.e. AI-enabled Cloud continuum, aims to automatically adapt to the growing complexity and data deluge by integrating seamlessly diverse computing and data environments by learning from monitoring and management of deployed services or applying AI techniques for dynamic load balancing to optimize energy consumption, resource usage or network traffic. To achieve this aim several efforts are underway. We will focus on the recent results related to coupling federated learning mechanisms and intelligent resource discovery to achieve an adaptive hosting environment capable of running both on Cloud and close to the Edge, machine learning in anomaly detection, or transprecision computing for distributed stream processing [2], [3], [4].",

		"abstract": "Serverless Computing is an emergent solution that helps deploy applications in the Cloud and sometimes on the Edge, reducing the integration time and the maintenance cost of the data centers. The lack of a standard for functions and the impossibility of connecting them together in complex workflows is currently holding back the growth of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) use. In this scenario, OpenWolf tries to overcome these issues by implementing a solution to spread functions over the Cloud-Edge Continuum and connecting them using a standardized Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to describe a serverless based workflow. In this work, we aim to enhance the OpenWolf project, solving many security threats the engine suffers, like the authenticated and authorized execution of workflows and the injection of malicious functions inside a workflow. We will validate this new version of OpenWolf in a Smart City surveillance scenario, providing validation and performance tests.",

The information technology advances in the healthcare sector have designed an innovative model, the so-called eHealth, that leverages the Cloud Computing paradigm. Even more, with the medical devices (seen as IoT devices) proliferation, there have been introduced new challenges for the Cloud-IoT centric infrastructure. In this context, traditional Health Information Technology (HIT) systems present several limitations, such as scalability, faulttolerance, interoperability, data management and so on. Starting from the experience reported at ISASI-CNR (ME), a healthcare and research center, in this paper, we motivate the need to move the traditional HIT systems into innovative infrastructures based on the Osmotic Computing paradigm. In particular, we introduce two real uses cases, Ataxia and Dyslexia projects.",

Thus, an opportunity is presented for data transfer-intensive, distributed machine learning. In this paper we develop a solution for serving distributed Machine Learning (ML) training jobs at the edge– cloud continuum. We model the specific requirements of each ML job, and the features of the edge and cloud resources. Next, we develop an Integer Linear Programming algorithm to perform the resource allocation. We examine different scenarios (different processing and bandwidth costs) and quantify tradeoffs related to performance and cost of edge/cloud bandwidth and processing resources. Our simulations indicate that even though there are many parameters that determine the allocation, the processing costs seem to play on average the most important role. The cloud b/w costs can be significant in certain scenarios. Finally, in certain examined cases, significant monetary benefits can be achieved through the collaboration of both edge and cloud resources when compared to using exclusively edge or cloud resources.",

In this talk, John will address how Intel views the reliability/resilience of large scale systems, how we test for user experience that might help users decide what is good for them, how we attempt to balance all the conflicting validation requirements in today's rapidly evolving landscape spanning consumption devices with short life spans to enterprise applications with very high uptime and reliability expectations.

		"abstract": "User-facing services are now evolving towards the microservice architecture where a service is built by connecting multiple microservice stages. Since the entire service is heavy, the microservice architecture shows the opportunity to only offload some microservice stages to the edge devices that are close to the end users. However, emerging techniques often result in the violation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) of microservice-based services in cloud-edge continuum, as they do not consider the communication overhead or the resource contention between microservices and external co-located tasks. We propose Nautilus, a runtime system that effectively deploys microservice-based user-facing services in cloud-edge continuum. Nautilus ensures the QoS of microservice-based user-facing services while minimizing the required computational resources, which is comprised of a communication-aware microservice mapper, a contention-aware resource manager and an IO-sensitive and load-aware microservice migration scheduler. The mapper divides the microservice graph into multiple partitions based on the communication overhead and maps the partitions to appropriate nodes. On each node, the resource manager determines the optimal resource allocation for its microservices based on reinforcement learning that may capture the complex contention behaviors. Once the microservices are suffered from external IO pressure, the IO-sensitive microservice scheduler migrates the critical one to idle nodes. Furthermore, when the load of microservices changes dynamically, the load-aware microservice scheduler migrates microservices from busy nodes to idle ones to ensure the QoS goal of the entire service. Our experimental results show that Nautilus can guarantee the required QoS target under external shared resources contention while the state-of-the-art suffers from QoS violations. Meanwhile, Nautilus reduces the computational resource usage by 23.9% and the network bandwidth usage by 53.4%, while achieving the required 99%-ile latency.",

		"abstract": "This paper presents an energy-aware workload allocation framework for Distributed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the Edge-Cloud continuum. As opposed to conventional approaches where the inference is performed in a standalone device, a computing-communication mode is proposed to distribute computing tasks of different layers of DNNs to different levels of the Edge-Cloud network to achieve the minimum energy cost per inference. The optimal exit layer (EL) can be determined where the intermediate data of the neural networks are transmitted to the higher level in the Edge-Cloud continuum. Case studies are illustrated for AlexNet and VGG-16 considering a set of DNN processors and wireless interfaces. Using the GPU GTX1080 with 22.8 GOPS/W and the WiFi with 10 nJ/bit transmission efficiency, the optimized energy consumption for AlexNet is estimated to be 0.016 J when the inference exits from the edge at the EL2 (Conv1) layer. For VGG-16, the optimal EL is EL1 with the minimum inference cost of 0.0482 J.",

		"abstract": "Microservices are a promising technology for future networks, and many research efforts have been devoted to optimally placing microservices in cloud data centers. However, microservices deployment in edge and in-network devices is more expensive than the cloud. Additionally, several works do not consider the main requirements of microservice architecture, such as service registry, failure detection, and each microservice's specific database. This paper investigates the problem of placing components (i.e. microservices and their corresponding databases) while considering physical nodes' failure and the distance to service registries. We propose a Components-aware Microservices Placement for In-Network Computing Cloud-Edge Continuum (CaMP-INC). We formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem with the objective of cost minimization. Due to the problem's \\mathcalNP-hardness, we propose a heuristic solution. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solution CaMP-INC reduces the total cost by 15.8% on average and has a superior performance in terms of latency minimization compared to benchmarks.",

However, in order to exploit the full potential of the edge-cloud infrastructure and platforms, applications have to be carefully crafted to be stateless and self-contained in small services or functions, i.e., the opposite of the classic stateful monolithic applications. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that allows stateful single applications to also exploit the full potential of the edge-cloud continuum. We explore the concept of Self-distributing Systems(SDS) as a general approach for code offloading and as an elastic application-level mechanism for performance scale-out on the edge-cloud continuum. Our preliminary results indicate that SDS enables enough flexibility for applications to fully explore the edge-cloud resource mixture. Particularly, we describe our state management strategies for stateful code mobility; explore SDS as a general mechanism to exploit horizontal scaling on the cloud; and examine SDS as a general code offloading mechanism to move code from edge to cloud, showing the scenarios where our approach enables applications to positively exploit the edgecloud continuum for better performance.",

The concept of a Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a research topic, but it promises to be an important step for harmonizing different models of the Edge-Cloud Continuum. The DTN software framework aims at helping network operations by providing updated and complete views on the network or parts of it, and it also introduces the possibility to simulate the network behavior or to learn from network events history (Machine Learning) without jeopardizing the actual operations of resources. In addition, thanks to the representation capabilities of the DT, its usage in the network promises to support different stakeholders’ views on their virtualized and physical infrastructure. This work tries to consolidate a DTN data model representing the elements of the Edge-Cloud Continuum by providing a layered (horizontal) and segmented (vertical) view of the infrastructure to all the involved stakeholders. The DTN model is an ontology where the linked classes represent properties and relations of networked components. This work aims to design a flexible and extensible ontology that describes the Edge-Cloud continuum usable in the telecommunications as well in the Cloud (IT and web) industries creating a bridge between the two.",

		"abstract": "Pervasive social networking (PSN) aims at bridging the gap between the services and users by providing a platform for social communication irrespective of the time and location. With the advent of a new era of high-speed telecommunication services, mobile users have evolved to a large extent demanding secure, private, and trustworthy services. Online social networks have evolved as pervasive online social networks (POSNs), which uses a common platform to connect users from hybrid applications. Trust has always been a concern for these networks. However, existing approaches tend to provide application-specific trust management, thus resulting in the cost of excessive network resource utilization and high computations. In this paper, a pervasive trust management framework is presented for POSNs, which is capable of generating high trust value between the users with a lower cost of monitoring. The proposed approach uses a flexible mixture model to develop the system around six different properties, and then utilizes the concept of osmotic computing to perform computational offloading, which reduces the number of computations as well as computational time. The novel concepts of lock door policy and intermediate state management procedure are used to allow trust visualization by providing efficient identification of trustworthy and untrustworthy users. The proposed approach is capable of predicting user ratings efficiently with extremely low errors, which are in the range of ±2. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using theoretical and numerical analyses along with data set-based simulations.",

		"abstract": "Osmotic Computing (OC) is an innovative computation paradigm that runs services on Cloud, Edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) resources based on their workload. Services are encapsulated in container images stored into a central repository on the Cloud. OC suffers from privacy and security issues, for example, hackers could attack the repository and download all container images. Furthermore, network latency could delay the deployment of services in Edge nodes. A possible solution to solve such problems is to employ Secret Share techniques to split the images of services into chunks and distribute them among Edge devices. This work aims at assessing the applicability of these techniques for OC employing the Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS) to split and store Micro-Elements (MELs). We made our analyses for different OC scenarios composed of 10, 100 and 1000 nodes running 1000 MELs each. Furthermore, we considered several degrees of redundancy from 0 to 7. From experimental analyses, we found that the reliability of the system increase with the increasing of the redundancy but the security decreases.",

It reduces complexity in positioning/interconnecting services across the continuum. A meta-model introduces high-level workflow descriptions as service networks with defined contracts and quality of service, thus enabling the deployment/management of workflows as first-class entities. It also provides automation based on policies, monitoring and heuristics. Tailored mechanisms orchestrate/manage services across the continuum, optimizing performance, cost, data protection and sustainability while managing risks. This model facilitates incremental development with visibility of design impacts and seamless evolution of applications and infrastructures.

This paper presents an extension to the TOSCA specification that allows for the definition of accelerator-aware services that can span from Cloud to Edge.

		"abstract": "The arrival of big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) era greatly promotes innovative in-network computing techniques, where the edge-cloud continuum becomes a feasible paradigm in handling multi-dimensional resources such as computing, storage, and communication. In this article, an energy constrained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile edge-cloud continuum framework is introduced, where the offloaded tasks from ground IoT devices can be cooperatively executed by UAVs acts as an edge server and cloud server connected to a ground base station (GBS), which can be seen as an access point. Specifically, a UAV is powered by the laser beam transmitted from a GBS, and can further charge IoT devices wirelessly. Here, an interesting task offloading and energy allocation problem is investigated by maximizing the long-term reward subject to executed task size and execution delay, under constraints such as energy causality, task causality, and cache causality. A federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) framework is proposed to learn the joint task offloading and energy allocation decision while reducing the training cost and preventing privacy leakage of DRL training. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme as compared to three baseline schemes.",

In this context, the efficient placement of service and network functions in the hosts of the continuum is an open and challenging problem. We formulate this problem as a scheduling process and we analyze its optimal performance through the integer linear programming toolkit.

They often require a hybrid execution infrastructure with IoT devices interconnected to cloud/HPC systems (aka Computing Continuum). Such workflows are subject to complex constraints and requirements in terms of performance, resource usage, energy consumption and financial costs. This makes it challenging to optimize their configuration and deployment. We propose a methodology to support the optimization of real-life applications on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum. We implement it as an extension of E2Clab, a previously proposed framework supporting the complete experimental cycle across the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum. Our approach relies on a rigorous analysis of possible configurations in a controlled testbed environment to understand their behaviour and related performance tradeoffs. We illustrate our methodology by optimizing Pl@ntNet, a world-wide plant identification application. Our methodology can be generalized to other applications in the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum.",

		"abstract": "With the ongoing, gradual shift of large-scale distributed systems towards the edge-cloud continuum, the need arises for software solutions that are universal, scalable, practical, and grounded in well-established technologies. Simultaneously, semantic technologies, especially in the streaming context, are becoming increasingly important for enabling interoperability in edge-cloud systems. However, in recent years, the field of semantic data streaming has been stagnant, and there are no available solutions that would fit those requirements. To fill this gap, in this contribution, a novel end-to-end RDF streaming approach is proposed (named Jelly). The method is simple to implement, yet very elastic, and designed to fit a wide variety of use cases. Its practical performance is evaluated in a series of experiments, including end-to-end throughput and latency measurements. It is shown that Jelly achieves vastly superior performance to the currently available approaches. The presented method makes significant progress towards enabling high-performance semantic data processing in numerous applications, including future edge-cloud systems. Moreover, this study opens up the possibility of applying and evaluating the method in real-life scenarios, which will be the focus of further research.",

Typically, with traditional symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes, data can be encrypted and sent into Cloud data centers, but this approach presents a great weakness: data must be transferred to the client-side to be deciphered and then processed. Nevertheless, such an approach is not feasible for a large amount of data. In this paper, we address such an issue through the adoption of homomorphic encryption in a Cloud/Edge continuum environment. Specifically, pieces of data are encrypted in the Edge and transferred into the Cloud for storage and processing without the need to decode them. Experiments performed on different homomorphic encryption schemes in a Cloud/Edge testbed highlight the goodness of our approach.",

In order to address such issues, in this talk, we propose an holistic integration of machine learning and multi-agent systems to create a data-driven control architecture capable to autonomically monitor and control the device-edge-cloud continuum. This objective is being developed in the context of the Horizon Europe project named MLSysOps (https://mlsysops.eu/). Some use cases will be proposed to elucidate our current findings.",

In this article, we have introduced the concept of a MultiCoT (http://www.MultiCoT.com) solution which refers to the collaborative execution of an IoT solution by multiple cloud vendors. Cloudlets and ad-hoc clouds are the extensions of centralized cloud services, closer to the user, in the form of fog and edge computing layers respectively and the Osmotic Computing (OC) serves as a glue by accomplishing the seamless compute sharing across these layers. The OC can also be integrated within a MultiCoT solution for extending it across three computational layers of cloud, fog and edge. However, this can only be achieved after establishing enough trust among all the vendors that are working in collaboration to simultaneously serve a particular MultiCoT solution. Blockchain has been already proven for establishing trust and supporting reliable interactions among independently operating entities. Hence, it can be used for establishing trust among the multiple cloud vendors serving a single MultiCoT solution. In this article, we have presented the importance of using the proactive Blockchain-enabled Osmotic Manager (B-OM) for improving the reliability of OC. We have also highlighted the blockchain features that can improve the reliability of OC by establishing trust among the independently operating vendors of a MultiCoT solution, followed by the challenges associated with the integration of blockchain and OC along with the future research directions for achieving the proposed integration.",

This development is notable especially given the rise in implementations of IoT edge/cloud continuum, a new computing paradigm that extends the cloud computing IoT via edge computing systems. In IoT cloud/edge continuum, benchmarking performance of the communication protocol of choice is critical. We focus for the first time on experimental benchmarking of HTTP/3 performance in an IoT cloud/edge continuum system. To benchmark the performance in terms of scalability and latency, we first implement HTTP/3 from a set of non-standardized open-source libraries, - which is challenge, and use the implementation in two main IoT scenarios: edge computing only (IoT devices running HTTP/3 clients and edge devices running an HTTP/3 server), and cloud/edge continuum (based on Google Firebase). Experimental results show that latency and scalability remain a challenge for HTTP/3, but its appeal also remains, in its wide adoption, embedded security and compatibility with existing networked systems.",

		"abstract": "As the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm enjoys growing popularity within Cloud-based systems, there is increasing interest in moving serverless functions towards the Edge, to better support geo-distributed and pervasive applications. However, enjoying both the reduced latency of Edge and the scalability of FaaS requires new architectures and implementations to cope with typical Edge challenges (e.g., nodes with limited computational capacity). While first solutions have been proposed for Edge-based FaaS, including light function sandboxing techniques, we lack a platform with the ability to span both Edge and Cloud and adaptively exploit both. In this paper, we present Serverledge, a FaaS platform designed for the Edge-to-Cloud continuum. Serverledge adopts a decentralized architecture, where function invocation requests can be fully served within Edge nodes. To cope with load peaks, Serverledge also supports vertical (i.e., from Edge to Cloud) and horizontal (i.e., among Edge nodes) computation offloading. Our evaluation shows that Serverledge outperforms Apache OpenWhisk in an Edge-like scenario and has competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks optimized for the Edge, with the advantage of built-in support for vertical and horizontal offloading.",

		"abstract": "As an essential part to intelligently fine-grained scheduling, planning and maintenance in smart grid and energy internet, short-term load forecasting makes great progress recently owing to the big data collected from smart meters and the leap forward in machine learning technologies. However, the centralized computing topology of classical electric information system, where individual electricity consumption data are frequently transmitted to the cloud center for load forecasting, tends to violate electric consumers’ privacy as well as to increase the pressure on network bandwidth. To tackle the tricky issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum for smart grid. Specifically, 1) we gravitate the training of load forecasting models and forecasting workloads to distributed smart meters so that consumers’ raw data are handled locally, and only the forecasting outputs that have been protected are reported to the cloud center via fog nodes; 2) we protect the local forecasting models that imply electricity features from model extraction attacks by model randomization; 3) we exploit a shuffle scheme among smart meters to protect the data ownership privacy, and utilize a re-encryption scheme to guarantee the forecasting data privacy. Finally, through comprehensive simulation and analysis, we validate our proposed privacy-preserving framework in terms of privacy protection, and computation and communication efficiency.",

		"abstract": "The importance of IoT analytics in smart deploy-ments has resulted in an increased use of powerful Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to extract insights from the growing amount of IoT sensor data. Traditional approaches that entirely offload computation and model deployment to cloud servers have been shown to be inefficient due to network congestion and latency concerns. However, with the improved capabilities of IoT devices, it has now become possible to distribute and host DNNs across IoT devices, edge servers and the cloud. In this paper, we propose a multi-user system, called T2C, to dynamically choose, deploy, monitor and control DNN-driven IoT analytics in a thing-to-cloud continuum. T2C leverages strategies such as multi-task learning, hitchhiking, early exit, and dynamic reconfiguration, to maximize the number of served user requests while simultaneously satisfying accuracy and latency requirements. We propose a suite of deployment planning and reconfiguration algorithms to dynamically deploy and migrate DNN layers between IoT devices, edge servers, and the cloud. We implement T2C in a prototype testbed and show that our system: (i) achieves 6.8X throughput boost compared to baseline algorithms in the planning phase, and (ii) improves the satisfied ratio by up to 35% in the operation and reconfiguration phase.",

		"abstract": "The exceedingly exponential-growing data rate highlighted numerous requirements and several approaches have been released to maximize the added-value of cloud and edge resources. Whereas data scientists utilize algorithmic models in order to transform datasets and extract actionable knowledge, a key challenge is oriented towards abstracting the underline layers: the ones enabling the management of infrastructure resources and the ones responsible to provide frameworks and components as services. In this sense, the serverless approach features as the novel paradigm of new cloud-related technology, enabling the agile implementation of applications and services. The concept of Function as a Service (FaaS) is introduced as a revolutionary model that offers the means to exploit serverless offerings. Developers have the potential to design their applications with the necessary scalability in the form of nanoservices without addressing themselves the way the infrastructure resources should be deployed and managed. By abstracting away the underlying hardware allocations, the data scientist concentrates on the business logic and critical problems of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This paper introduces an approach to realize the provision of ML Functions as a Service (i.e., ML-FaaS), by exploiting the Apache OpenWhisk event-driven, distributed serverless platform. The presented approach tackles also composite services that consist of single ones i.e., workflows of ML tasks including processes such as aggregation, cleaning, feature extraction, and analytics; thus, reflecting the complete data path. We also illustrate the operation of the approach mentioned above and assess its performance and effectiveness exploiting a holistic, end-toend anti-fraud detection machine learning pipeline.",

		"abstract": "Cloud computing is increasing rapidly as a successful paradigm presenting on-demand infrastructure, platform, and software services to clients. Load balancing is one of the important issues in cloud computing to distribute the dynamic workload equally among all the nodes to avoid the status that some nodes are overloaded while others are underloaded. Many algorithms have been suggested to perform this task. Recently, worldview is turning into a new paradigm for optimization search by applying the osmosis theory from chemistry science to form osmotic computing. Osmotic computing is aimed to achieve balance in highly distributed environments. The main goal of this paper is to propose a hybrid metaheuristics technique which combines the osmotic behavior with bio-inspired load balancing algorithms. The osmotic behavior enables the automatic deployment of virtual machines (VMs) that are migrated through cloud infrastructures. Since the hybrid artificial bee colony and ant colony optimization proved its efficiency in the dynamic environment in cloud computing, the paper then exploits the advantages of these bio-inspired algorithms to form an osmotic hybrid artificial bee and ant colony (OH_BAC) optimization load balancing algorithm. It overcomes the drawbacks of the existing bio-inspired algorithms in achieving load balancing between physical machines. The simulation results show that OH_BAC decreases energy consumption, the number of VMs migrations and the number of shutdown hosts compared to existing algorithms. In addition, it enhances the quality of services (QoSs) which is measured by service level agreement violation (SLAV) and performance degradation due to migrations (PDMs).",

		"abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. A record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Internet of Things (IoT) applications today involve data capture from sensors and devices that are close to the phenomenon being measured, with such data subsequently being transmitted to Cloud data centre for storage, analysis and visualisation. Currently devices used for data capture often differ from those that are used to subsequently carry out analysis on such data. Increasing availability of storage and processing devices closer to the data capture device, perhaps over a one-hop network connection or even directly connected to the IoT device itself, requires more efficient allocation of processing across such edge devices and data centres. Supporting machine learning & data analytics directly on edge devices also enables support for distributed (federated) learning, enabling user devices to be used directly in the inference or learning process. Scalability in this context needs to consider both cloud resources, data distribution and initial processing on edge resources closer to the user. This talk investigates how a data analytics pipeline can be deployed across the cloud-edge continuum. Understanding what should be executed at a data centre and what can be moved to an edge resource remains an important challenge – especially with increasing capability of our edge devices. The following questions are addressed in this talk: How do we partition machine learning algorithms across Edge-Network-Cloud resources (often referred to as the \"Cloud-Edge Continuum\") based on constraints such as privacy, capacity and resilience? Can machine learning algorithms be adapted based on the characteristics of devices on which they are hosted? What does this mean for stability/ convergence vs. performance? Do we trade-off accuracy for “explainability” of results? Given a complex parameter space can “approximations” help with explaining the basis of results?",

		"abstract": "We consider a hierarchical edge-cloud architecture in which services are provided to mobile users as chains of virtual network functions. Each service has specific computation requirements and target delay performance, which require placing the corresponding chain properly and allocating a suitable amount of computing resources. Furthermore, chain migration may be necessary to meet the services’ target delay. We model and formalize the problem of finding a feasible chain placement and resource allocation, while minimizing the migration, bandwidth, and computation costs. We tackle this problem by partitioning it into a (i) CPU allocation problem, and a (ii) placement problem. For the CPU allocation problem, we find an optimal solution. For the placement problem, we show that even finding a feasible solution is NP-hard, and envision an algorithm that is guaranteed to find a feasible solution while leveraging a bounded amount of resource augmentation. Our algorithms are incorporated into a solution framework that aims to minimize both the cost and the required resource augmentation. The results, obtained through trace-driven, large-scale simulations, show that our framework can provide a close-to-optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster than an ILP solver.",

		"abstract": "Foliar pigment concentrations have the potential to provide information regarding the physiological status of vegetation. Since foliar pigments cause wavelength specific absorption, these spectral regions and metrics derived there from, have been applied to estimate pigment concentrations. Some literature suggests that foliar attributes not related to chlorophyll concentrations influence the reflectance-pigment relationship. To investigate the appropriateness of these relationships across species with different pigment types and potentially different mesophyll cell structure, a dataset was collected throughout fall senescence. This dataset provided a wide range of pigment levels for five dissimilar tree species. Regression models were generated and compared. This data determined that the widely applied red edge position is sensitive to different tree species. Not only were different model coefficients found but occasionally different functions. The continuum removed and depth normalized left area appears to be a more robust alternative to REP for estimating chlorophyll.",

The 6G should begin to be specified in 2028 to be commercialized in 2030, ten years after the 5G. The 5G-Advanced will be released in 2025. Specifications begin to be well defined and give some indications if the 6G is presented as the continuation of the 5G. If there is a strong break, it will be to go to a completely distributed environment in which MEC data centers (Multi-Access Edge Computing) will be embedded in terminal equipment or in nodes located a few tens meters from the users. The solution that seems to be emerging is an aggregation of the two previous solutions using the Cloud Continuum, i.e. data centers ranging from embedded Edge to hyperscalers. Virtual machines that will support all applications, common services and digital infrastructure services will need to find the best position within the Cloud Continuum to optimize safety, quality of service and resiliency. Artificial intelligence will play a particularly important role in automating the entire system and optimizing controls.",

Emerging low- V_\\mathbf DD logic devices such as tunnel FET (TFETs) offer better low- V_\\mathbf DD performance than conventional MOSFETs but lack performance at high- V_\\mathbf DD . To assess TFETs, and other transistors optimized for low- V_\\mathbf DD operation, we propose a technology-driven design framework. Our framework adapts standard industry flows and tools to optimize the design of logic blocks with full consideration of the tradeoffs possible with the future generation device I – V characteristics and interconnect. Proposed approach optimizes design implementation to improve projected power-performance and area, as well as, expected accuracy of the projections. TFET improves energy efficiency by 2.35 \\times and 1.35 \\times over MOSFET at low- and high-performance points, respectively, for industrial design test cases. Accuracy of the energy efficiency and performance projections is improved by 71% and 40%, respectively.",

		"abstract": "With Digital transformation, the diversity of services and infrastructure in backhaul fog network(s) is rising to unprecedented levels. This is causing a rising threat of a wider range of cyber attacks coupled with a growing integration of constrained range of infrastructure, particularly seen at the network edge. Deep reinforcement-based learning is an attractive approach to detecting attacks, as it allows less dependency on labeled data with better ability to classify different attacks. However, current approaches to learning are known to be computationally expensive (cost) and the learning experience can be negatively impacted by the presence of outliers and noise (quality). This work tackles both the cost and quality challenges with a novel service-based federated deep reinforcement learning solution, enabling anomaly detection and attack classification at a reduced data cost and with better quality. The federated settings in the proposed approach enable multiple edge units to create clusters that follow a bottom-up learning approach. The proposed solution adapts deep Q-learning Network (DQN) for service-tunable flow classification, and introduces a novel federated DQN (FDQN) for federated learning. Through such targeted training and validation, variation in data patterns and noise is reduced. This leads to improved performance per service with lower training cost. Performance and cost of the solution, along with sensitivity to exploration parameters are evaluated using an example publicly available dataset (UNSW-NB15). Evaluation results show the proposed solution to maintain detection accuracy with lower data supply, while improving the classification rate by a factor of ≈ 2.",

		"abstract": "In Industry 4.0, the emergence of the Internet of industrial things (IoIT) has been a mainstream computing infrastructure for smart factories. However, IoITs show a multitude of inherent weaknesses which may restrict IoITs from fulfilling implementation expectations due to the con-figuration of the Cloud-Edge continuum. Under the needs of high-level production chain business continuity, an IoIT may be influenced by parametric or structural changes on one hand, but the system may also fail on the other. These possible events may be quantified using two metrics: survivability and resilience. This work proposes to model and evaluate a specific IoIT for survivability and resiliency quantification using a hierarchical model. The system model consists of three layers: (i) reliability block diagram (RBD) at the top level to capture the overall IoIT architecture, (ii) fault tree (FT) at the middle level to capture the configurations of subsystems, and (iii) continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models at the bottom level to represent the operational states of the underlying components and devices. The study can assist system managers in ensuring the maximum level of survivability and resiliency of industrial processes in smart factories by preserving operating circumstances and system configurations.",

Hundreds of such questions are asked by software engineers who have many cloud services at their disposition, but increasingly also many other hosting options around managed edge devices and fog spectrums, including for functions and container hosting (FaaS/CaaS). Especially for composite applications prevalent in this field, the combinatorial deployment space is exploding. We claim that a systematic and automated approach is unavoidable in order to scale functional decomposition applications further so that each hosting facility is fully exploited. To support engineers while they transition from cloud-native to continuum-native, we provide a rule-based matchmaker called RBMM that combines several decision factors typically present in software description formats and applies rules to them. Using the MaestroNG orchestrator and OsmoticToolkit, we also contribute an integration of the matchmaker into an actual deployment environment.",

		"abstract": "Technological changes (NFV, Osmotic Computing, Cyber-physical Systems) are making very important devising techniques to efficiently run a flow of jobs formed by dependent tasks in a set of servers. These problem can be seen as generalizations of the dynamic job-shop scheduling problem, with very rich dependency patterns and arrival assumptions. In this work, we consider a computational model of a distributed system formed by a set of servers in which jobs, that are continuously arriving, have to be executed. Every job is formed by a set of dependent tasks (i. e., each task may have to wait for others to be completed before it can be started), each of which has to be executed in one of the servers. The arrival of jobs and their properties is assumed to be controlled by a bounded adversary, whose only restriction is that it cannot overload any server. This model is a non-trivial generalization of the Adversarial Queuing Theory model of Borodin et al., and, like that model, focuses on the stability of the system: whether the number of jobs pending to be completed is bounded at all times. We show multiple results of stability and instability for this adversarial model under different combinations of the scheduling policy used at the servers, the arrival rate, and the dependence between tasks in the jobs.",

		"abstract": "During heavy traffic transactions on a network, there is an extreme impact on network resources such as bare metals, routers, I/Os, enterprise applications and services. The arrival rates usually exceed service rates despite Ethernet TCP windowing and layer-3 fair queuing. This is unacceptable in Osmotic computing paradigm which houses machine to machine cloud elasticity especially for IoT plug and play edge devices. This research proposes Fog and server consolidation (SC) in distributed high performance data centers (D-HPDCs) as a middleware solution to solve the problem. A candidate scheme called green virtualization is used to share the capabilities of physical servers (bare metals) by splitting resources among operating systems that host an on-demand smart grid application. AType-I virtual machine hypervisor is used to mitigate the various pitfalls in legacy datacenters (DCs) such as resource availability, query response time, scalability and network quality of service (QoS). MATLAB SimEvent simulation is used to realize a case-based Branch-and-Bound heuristics as an optimization scheme in the green virtualized DC. Within the elasticity zone, performance evaluation between Type-I virtualized and non-virtualized DC is carried out. The benefits of virtualized DCs using cloud elasticity design framework is highlighted. The results showed that the Type-1 virtualized DC scenario had better QoS performance metrics compared with the non-virtualized DC. Consequently, SC using virtualization is shown to be efficient for supporting multi-constrained DC environments.",

The developed software system uses locomotion data generated by wearables on cows’ feet to detect anomalies in their behaviour. We analyze the benefits of using a fog computing assisted approach for developing such IoT solutions. We use resource utilization as the performance metric for analyzing the benefits of leveraging the fog computing paradigm compared to the traditional cloud centric approach. The results suggest that a fog enabled software system brings benefits such as efficient utilization of computing resources, improved QoS etc. The evaluation indicates that there will be need of special design (including both low-level and high-level system design) re-configurations and also re-engineering of some components to provide higher scalability using less computational resources.",

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are well suited for such needs owing to their high mobility and agility. This paper considers a software-defined edge network consisting of UAVs equipped with wireless access points which serve mobile users with latency-sensitive workload in an edge-to-cloud continuum setting. It investigates the task offloading paradigm to provide prioritized services via this on-demand aerial network. Accordingly a task processing optimization model is defined to minimize the overall penalty calculated based on priority-weighted delay values against a priori defined task deadlines. Since the defined assignment problem is NP-hard tailored heuristic models are proposed and evaluated to study how the system performs under different operating conditions",

Considering these constraints when scheduling functions leads to sensible performance improvements, e.g., minimising loading times or data-access latencies. This issue becomes more pressing when considered in the emerging multi-cloud and edge-cloud-continuum systems, where only specific nodes can access specialised, local resources. To address this problem, we present a declarative language for defining serverless scheduling policies to express constraints on topologies of schedulers and execution nodes. We implement our approach as an extension of the OpenWhisk platform.",

		"abstract": "Fog computing is an end-to-end horizontal architecture that distributes computing, storage, control, and networking functions closer to users along the cloud-to-thing continuum. The word “edge” may carry different meanings. A common usage of the term refers to the edge network as opposed to the core network, with equipment such as edge routers, base stations, and home gateways. In that sense, there are several differences between fog and edge. First, fog is inclusive of cloud, core, metro, edge, clients, and things. The fog architecture will further enable pooling, orchestrating, managing, and securing the resources and functions distributed in the cloud, anywhere along the cloud-to-thing continuum, and on the things to support end-to-end services and applications. Second, fog seeks to realize a seamless continuum of computing services from the cloud to the things rather than treating the network edges as isolated computing platforms. Third, fog envisions a horizontal platform that will support the common fog computing functions for multiple industries and application domains, including but not limited to traditional telco services. Fourth, a dominant part of edge is mobile edge, whereas the fog computing architecture will be flexible enough to work over wireline as well as wireless networks.",

		"abstract": "Recent advances in virtualization technologies and distributed networking architectures have led to an increased interest in jointly considering computation and forwarding in network nodes. This is spurred in great parts by the proliferation of edge computing as a complementary or even alternative to centralized cloud computing and supplementing data centers for data‐driven, time‐sensitive, and critical applications and telemetry. These trends have given rise to the concept of the edge‐cloud continuum, the melding of networking and computing with common and tightly integrated resource allocation capabilities from the edge of the network to the back‐end cloud infrastructure including computing and storage. The network is becoming more like a distributed computer board than the telephone network of yore: instead of providing connections and forwarding, the network can now be considered as an essential constituent of the applications themselves where the boundaries between the networking and computing domains are redefined. Although the joint optimization of communication and computation resource allocation has already been proposed in the past, it predated the current softwarization of networks, the development of new resource sharing paradigms in mobile networks, as well as the rise of data‐driven approaches including machine learning. The availability of new hardware architectures (e.g. Tofino) and programming frameworks (e.g. P4) makes it possible to perform some in‐network computing at line speed. In order to better understand the fundamental changes that computing will bring to the 6G era, this chapter examines the state of the art of the in‐network computation areas and how the edge‐cloud continuum should evolve to support the next generation of applications and service.",

		"abstract": "Vector extensions are a popular mean to exploit data parallelism in applications. Over recent years, the most commonly used extensions have been growing in vector length and amount of vector instructions. However, code portability remains a problem when speaking about a compute continuum. Hence, vector length agnostic (VLA) architectures have been proposed for the future generations of ARM and RISC-V processors. With these architectures, code is vectorized independently of the vector length of the target hardware platform. It is therefore possible to tune software to a generic vector length. To understand the performance impact of VLA code compared to vector length specific code, we analyze the current capabilities of code generation for ARM's SVE architecture. Our experiments show that VLA code reaches about 90% of the performance of vector length specific code, i.e. a 10% overhead is inferred due to global predication of instructions. Furthermore, we show that code performance is not increasing proportionally with increasing vector lengths due to the higher memory demands.",

		"abstract": "AI is one of the biggest megatrends towards the 4th industrial revolution. Although these technologies promise business sustainability as well as product and process quality, it seems that the ever-changing market demands, the complexity of technologies and fair concerns about privacy, impede broad application and reuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across the industry. To break the entry barriers for these technologies and unleash its full potential, the knowlEdge project will develop a new generation of AI methods, systems, and data management infrastructure. Subsequently, as part of the knowlEdge project we propose several major innovations in the areas of data management, data analytics and knowledge management including (i) a set of AI services that allows the usage of edge deployments as computational and live data infrastructure as well as a continuous learning execution pipeline on the edge, (ii) a digital twin of the shop-floor able to test AI models, (iii) a data management framework deployed along the edge-to-cloud continuum ensuring data quality, privacy and confidentiality, (iv) Human-AI Collaboration and Domain Knowledge Fusion tools for domain experts to inject their experience into the system, (v) a set of standardisation mechanisms for the exchange of trained AI models from one context to another, and (vi) a knowledge marketplace platform to distribute and interchange trained AI models. In this paper, we present a short overview of the EU Project knowlEdge –Towards Artificial Intelligence powered manufacturing services, processes, and products in an edge-to-cloud-knowledge continuum for humans [in-the-loop], which is funded by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) Framework Programme of the European Commission under Grant Agreement 957331.

At the same time, the proliferation of edge computing, a complementary and at times alternative solution to centralized cloud computing, has resulted in an edge-cloud continuum of applications and services. Edge computing offers more proximate resources closer to where the service is needed and supports emerging applications (e.g., self-driving vehicles, autonomous systems, and VR/AR) with stringent requirements of fast response, low delay, high bandwidth, trust-sensitivity, and/or continued operation, despite intermittent or incomplete connectivity. These trends have converged into the concept of Computing in the Network (COIN), the integration of in-network computation and network processing in a common framework.

Typically, due to their limited storage capacity, pieces of data are continuously exchanged with Cloud systems which store them in distributed DataBase Management System (DBMS). This scenario, known as Cloud/Edge Continuum, is critical from a data security point of view as it is exposed to many risks. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is proposed as a possible solution for encrypting database files. However, current solutions do not suit the Cloud/Edge continuum requirements. In this paper, we aim at fulfilling this gap by proposing a solution to encrypt the data locally at the Edge and transfer them to a distributed database over the Cloud. Our approach allows us to perform queries directly on encrypted data over the Cloud and to retrieve them on the Edge for decryption. Experiments performed on different NoSQL DBMS solutions demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

The adoption of the Internet of Things paradigm, the use of the MicroServices Architecture for applications and the possibility of deploying such applications at different layers (fog, edge, cloud), makes the selection of an appropriate deployment a critical task for network operators and developers. In this paper, an emulation framework is proposed to allow them make a decision for the network, computing and application deployment in the cloud continuum, while satisfying the required Quality of Service. The framework is compatible both for IP and SDN network paradigms and is extensible to different types of scenarios thanks to its approach based on Docker containers. The evaluation over a realistic network scenario shows that it is extensible to any scenario and deployment required by the research community working on the cloud continuum.",

Recent trends for resource orchestration across the entire compute continuum raise the need for decision making at low timescales, a requirement which can be hardly met by centralized resource optimizers that rely either on Linear Programming or Machine Learning (ML). In this respect, we present a distributed approach tailored to a crucial resource orchestration aspect, i.e., the embedding of Service Function Chains (SFCs) onto large-scale virtualized network infrastructures. In order to confront the computational hardness of the SFC embedding problem, we utilize a clustering method for the partitioning of the solution space, empowering the search for efficient solutions in parallel across all clusters. Another salient feature of our approach is the use of unsupervised deep learning for the computation of embeddings within each cluster. Our distributed SFC embedding framework is benchmarked against a state-of-the-art heuristic and a distributed greedy algorithm.

		"abstract": "Dynamic network architectures that utilize communication, computing, and storage resources at the wireless edge are key to delivering emerging services in next-generation networks (e.g., AR/VR, 3D video, intelligent cars, etc). Network slicing can be significantly enhanced by including dynamically available resources throughout the fog/edge/cloud continuum and using mmWave/THz bands. However, network slicing of dynamic multi-tier computing networks remains under-explored. In this paper, we present a self-learning end-to-end network slicing mechanism (SELF-E2E-NS) that facilitates collaboration between the Infrastructure Provider (InP) and tenants to slice their subscribers’ resources (i.e., radio, computing, and storage) as fog resources. To adapt to the uncertain availability of resources at the edge and minimize the risk of non-satisfying service level agreements (SLAs), our slicing mechanism has two operational modes. Operational mode 1 is for joint network slicing (JNS) in which the InP infrastructure is augmented with fog resources and jointly sliced to meet high throughput and delay tolerant requirements. Operational mode 2 is for independent network slicing (INS) in which the InP infrastructure and fog resources are sliced separately to achieve high throughput, low-latency, and high-reliability requirements. Our schemes leverage mmWave/THz, fog/edge/cloud computing, and caching to achieve new service requirements. We design a DQ-E2E-JNS algorithm that uses Deep Dueling network and a MAAC-E2E-INS algorithm based on multi-agent actor-critic, which incorporate service-aware pricing feedback and fog trading matching, respectively. These algorithms find the optimal slice request admission and collaboration policy that maximizes the long-term revenue of the InP and tenants for each mode. The simulation results show that our novel slicing mechanism can serve up to 4 times more requests and effectively exploits different spectrum bands and fog resources to improve revenue and performance.",

		"abstract": "The widespread diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an exponential growth in the volume of data generated at the edge of the network. With the rapid spread of machine learning (ML)-based applications, performing compute and resource-intensive learning tasks at the edge has become a critical issue, resulting in the need for scalable and efficient solutions that can overcome the resource constraints of edge devices. This paper analyzes the problem of scaling ML applications and algorithms at the edge-cloud continuum from a distributed computing perspective. In particular, we first highlight the limitations of traditional distributed architectures (e.g., clusters, clouds, and HPC systems) when running ML applications that use data generated at the edge. Next, we discuss how to enable traditional ML algorithms combining the benefits of edge computing, such as low-latency processing and privacy preservation of personal user data, with those of cloud computing, such as virtually unlimited computational and storage capabilities. Our analysis provides insights into how properly separated parts of a ML application can be deployed across edge-cloud architectures in order to optimize its execution. More-over, examples of ML applications and algorithms appropriately adapted for the edge-cloud continuum are shown.",

		"abstract": "Defining a scheduling and orchestration strategy for modern distributed microservices-based applications is a complex problem to deal with, especially if they are deployed on geo-distributed Cloud-to-Edge environments. Kubernetes is today the de-facto standard for container orchestration on Cloud data centers. However, its static container scheduling strategy is not suitable for the placement of complex and distributed microservices-based applications on Edge environments. Current infrastructure network conditions and resource availability neither run time application state are taken into account when scheduling microservices. To deal with these limitations in this work we present an extension of the Kubernetes platform in order to implement an effective application and infrastructure-aware container scheduling and orchestration strategy. In particular, we propose an extension of the default Kubernetes scheduler that considers application and infrastructure telemetry data when taking scheduling decisions. Furthermore, a descheduler component is also proposed that continuously tunes the application placement based on the ever changing application and infrastructure states. An evaluation of the proposed approach is presented by comparing it with the default Kubernetes scheduling strategy.",

The landing platforms for the deployment of such compositions are progressively becoming capable to offer capabil-ities that support such advanced QoS requests (e.g., low latency via 5G network slice) spanning the Edge-Cloud Continuum. Actual deployment solutions focus mainly on resource allocation (i.e., CPU, memory, and storage), falling short of addressing advanced QoS and unleashing the true potential of the Edge-Cloud Continuum. In this paper, we present an automatic QoS-aware deployment solution for composed services in the Edge-Cloud Continuum.

		"abstract": "Cloud infrastructures are rapidly evolving from centralised systems to geographically distributed federations of edge devices, fog nodes, and clouds. These federations (often referred to as the Cloud-Edge Continuum) are the foundation upon which most modern digital systems depend, and consume enormous amounts of energy. This consumption is becoming a critical issue as society's energy challenges grow, and is a great concern for power grids which must balance the needs of clouds against other users. The Continuum is highly dynamic, mobile, and complex; new methods to improve energy efficiency must be based on formal scientific models that identify and take into account a huge range of heterogeneous components, interactions, stochastic properties, and (potentially contradictory) service-level agreements and stakeholder objectives. Currently, few formal models of federated Cloud-Edge systems exist - and none adequately represent and integrate energy considerations (e.g. multiple providers, renewable energy sources, pricing, and the need to balance consumption over large-areas with other non-Cloud consumers, etc.). This paper conducts a systematic analysis of current approaches to modelling Cloud, Cloud-Edge, and federated Continuum systems with an emphasis on the integration of energy considerations. We identify key omissions in the literature, and propose an initial high-level architecture and approach to begin addressing these - with the ultimate goal to develop a set of integrated models that include data centres, edge devices, fog nodes, energy providers, software workloads, end users, and stakeholder requirements and objectives. We conclude by highlighting the key research challenges that must be addressed to enable meaningful energy-aware Cloud-Edge Continuum modelling and simulation.",

		"abstract": "Scheduling workloads on large-scale infrastructures, such as in the Edge-Cloud continuum is a challenging task. Usually, the scheduling algorithm considers only a limited sample of the infrastructure nodes, typically obtained through random sampling. The sampling reduces the number of nodes, which need to be evaluated in the scheduling pipeline, making the scheduling process more saleable. Unfortunately, current sampling approaches become largely inefficient when the infrastructure is heterogeneous and specific, scarce node characteristics are required to successfully execute a workload. Computing continuum infrastructures are heterogeneous, hence, we need to re-think the sampling process to keep it viable at scale while also being able to identify and leverage the heterogeneity of the Edge-Cloud continuum resources. In this article, we present Intelligent Sampling - a novel technique for improving sampling in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. We develop a model for any heterogeneous infrastructure. Based on this model, we provide a method to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific task at hand. Finally, we leverage the Alibaba PAI dataset to show that our approach is 2.5x times more accurate compared with other state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms while retaining comparable performance and scalability.",

		"abstract": "While machine learning applications in IoT devices are getting more widespread, the computational and power limitations of these devices pose a great challenge. To handle this increasing computational burden, edge, and cloud solutions emerge as a means to offload computation to more powerful devices. However, the unstable nature of network connections constantly changes the communication costs, making the offload process (i.e., when and where to transfer data) a dynamic trade-off. In this work, we propose DECOS: a framework to automatically select at run-time the best offloading solution with minimum latency based on the computational capabilities of devices and network status at a given moment. We use heterogeneous devices for edge and Cloud nodes to evaluate the framework’s performance using MobileNetV1 CNN and network traffic data from a real-world 4G bandwidth dataset. DECOS effectively selects the best processing node to maintain the minimum possible latency, reducing it up to 29% compared to Cloud-exclusive processing while reducing the energy consumption by 1.9\\times compared to IoT-exclusive execution.",

When working with edge devices these desiderata are usually achieved through replication and offloading. This paper reports on the design and implementation of a fault-tolerant service that enables the offloading of jobs from devices with limited computational power. We propose a solution that allows users to upload jobs through a web service, which will be executed on edge nodes within the system. The solution is designed to be fault tolerant and scalable, with no single point of failure as well as the ability to accommodate growth, if the service is expanded. The use of Docker checkpointing on the worker machines ensures that jobs can be resumed in the event of a fault. We provide a mathematical approach to optimize the number of checkpoints that are created along a computation, given that we can forecast the time needed to execute a job. We present experiments that indicate in which scenarios checkpointing benefits job execution. Our experiments shows the benefits of using checkpointing and restore when the completion jobs’ time rises compared with the forecast fault rate.",

		"abstract": "Use of the serverless paradigm in cloud application development is growing rapidly, primarily driven by its promise to free developers from the responsibility of provisioning, operating, and scaling the underlying infrastructure. However, modern cloud-edge infrastructures are characterized by large numbers of disparate providers, constrained resource devices, platform heterogeneity, infrastructural dynamicity, and the need to orchestrate geographically distributed nodes and devices over public networks. This presents significant management complexity that must be addressed if serverless technologies are to be used in production systems. This position paper introduces COGNIT, a major new European initiative aiming to integrate AI technology into cloud-edge management systems to create a Cognitive Cloud reference framework and associated tools for serverless computing at the edge. COGNIT aims to: 1) support an innovative new serverless paradigm for edge application management and enhanced digital sovereignty for users and developers; 2) enable on-demand deployment of large-scale, highly distributed and self-adaptive serverless environments using existing cloud resources; 3) optimize data placement according to changes in energy efficiency heuristics and application demands and behavior; 4) enable secure and trusted execution of serverless runtimes. We identify and discuss seven research challenges related to the integration of serverless technologies with multi-provider Edge infrastructures and present our vision for how these challenges can be solved. We introduce a high-level view of our reference architecture for serverless cloud-edge continuum systems, and detail four motivating real-world use cases that will be used for validation, drawing from domains within Smart Cities, Agriculture and Environment, Energy, and Cybersecurity.",

		"abstract": "Quantum processing units (QPUs) are currently exclusively available from cloud vendors. However, with recent advancements, hosting QPUs will soon be possible everywhere. Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work.",

		"abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a recent approach for distributed Machine Learning (ML) where data are never communicated to a central node. Instead, an ML model (for example, a deep neural network) is initialized by a designated central (aggregation) node and shared with training nodes that have direct access to data of interest. These training nodes then perform small batches of training on their local data. Periodically, each training node submits ML model parameter/weight updates to the central node. The central node aggregates the parameters/weights to create a new global ML model that it then re-shares with the training nodes. This process can either take place indefinitely or be repeated until the ML model converges with respect to some evaluation metric (for example, mean average error, accuracy).",

		"abstract": "A range of options exist to implement today's digital architectures. Although an oversimplification, we can think of these options along a spectrum: At one extreme is a single instance “data center,” which might be an enterprise data center or a colocation facility, or perhaps even a single server or rack containing a database or application. Adjacent to that option is a set of perhaps dozens of hyperscale cloud facilities, with perhaps hundreds of thousands of servers, typically geographically distributed. As we continue through various layers of “fog,” we hit the near edge, which might include facilities in major metros, and then the far edge, which might include computing nodes located on every street corner, or spaced several per mile along a traffic corridor such as a superhighway. These then typically tie to endpoint elements, such as devices or things-for example, smart meters, irrigation sensors, smartphones, smart TVs, or connected vehicles. Sometimes individual processors will be aggregated into a system, such as an autonomous vehicle with a hundred or more micro-processors, or perhaps its entertainment system, or a network of systems, such as a factory including its robots, quality inspection systems, materials handling systems, and fire/smoke detection sensors.",

In computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly pervasive, distributed, and often, cooperative. It is an area that has been engineered for 7+ decades (and is ultimately based on the work of Alan Turing a decade before that) and, until recently, has focused on enabling systems to perform tasks, usually repetitive and routine in nature (for example robots in automobile manufacturing). Things are changing, though. AI has been making dramatic progress in generic domains such as speech recognition, visual perception, search, and language translation as well as in industry-specific applications such as manufacturing, education, and healthcare.
