abstract = {Technological advancements have led to an increase in teaching the fundamentals of cloud computing, robotics and autonomous systems and their importance, relying on strong hands-on practical experimentation. The National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported testbeds have opened the doors for experimentation and support in the next era of computing platforms and large-scale cloud research. In this paper, we present an educational module that conveys accessibility to education, aiming to prepare learners for technological career paths with the motivation to bring hands-on sessions, and on the idea of building a freely available set of artifacts that can serve the educational community. Specifically, we present AutoLearn: Learning in the Edge to Cloud Continuum, an educational module that integrates a collection of artifacts, based on a small scale open-source self-driving platform that leverages the Chameleon Cloud testbed to teach cloud computing concepts, edge devices technology, and artificial intelligence driven applications.},

abstract = {The orchestration of serverless applications presents different challenges due to the increasing request load they need to manage and the time-sensitive requirements. The combination of Cloud and Edge computing paradigms attempts to avoid their pitfalls while taking the best of both worlds: Cloud scalability and computing closer to the Edge where data is typically generated. However, placing microservices in such heterogeneous environments while meeting QoS constraints is a challenging task due to the geo-distribution of nodes and varying computational resources. In this paper we propose to extend Knative, an example of a serverless computing framework based on the Kubernetes platform, to enable dynamic serverless application orchestration, taking into account both infrastructure and application states. Our approach aims to reduce QoS violations and improve application response time in Cloud-to-Edge continuum scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive data delivery method for data science pipelines. While this method is feasible for processes communicating over any network, in this work we focus on edge-fog-cloud infrastructures. In a diagnostic phase, a model based on the Bernoulli principle is used to create a representation of bottlenecks in a pipeline. In a supervision phase, a watchman/sentinel cooperative system monitors the throughput of the pipeline stages to create a bottleneck-stage scheme. In a rectification phase, this system produces replicas of bottlenecks stages, mitigating the workload congestion using implicit parallelism and load balancing algorithms. This method is automatically and transparently invoked to produce a steady continuum dataflow. To test our proposal, we conducted a case study about the processing of medical and satellite data. The evaluation revealed that this method creates continuum dataflows, without neither characterising workloads nor knowing infrastructure details, which yields a competitive performance with state-of-the-art solutions.},

It promises lower latency due to this proximity, provided that the applications run are carefully matched to the smaller resources of the edge data centres. However, a holistic management of the resulting cloud-edge continuum that takes into account the constraints of the edge nodes and the needs of complex applications is not yet available.The goal of this thesis is to design, implement, and validate a new SLO-oriented management layer for cloud-edge infrastructures.

abstract = {Edge computing is increasing its popularity also in non-computing specific environments. In particular, Makerspaces are facing the issue of providing cognitive-edge to cloud computational power to their users, for running their 3D modeling and optimizations. However, while the edge-to-cloud offloading might be a traditional issue in edge computing systems, some countries require Makerspaces to provide their service only during operational hours, and therefore to switch off their machines, including their servers, during the night. This calls for the need for flexible computational offloading, enabling to checkpoint of current tasks and restoring them during opening hours. This work examines the feasibility of designing and implementing such a system, to facilitate computational offloading with checkpointing to increase the availability of computational power. We propose and prototype the implementation for a system that enables a provider to provide computational power through their edge with a checkpoint and restore feature to prevent loss of progress while the system works on a computation. A client-side application was designed and implemented to enable users to access the computational offloading service from a provider at a given location directly from their smartphone. Results show that it is possible to implement a continuous edge-to-cloud computational platform to enable full checkpoint and restore of computational tasks while providing a good quality of service and using a controlled amount of energy.},

abstract = {Data is a critical asset in today’s world. When multiple actors are involved, ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized parties and protecting it against theft present significant challenges. A potential solution to these issues is creating data spaces that interconnect clusters managed by different actors. The latter can securely exchange data under specific constraints and terminate connections when needed. This paper aims to show how infrastructure-level data spaces, which support both access to data, and processing of it, can facilitate secure data exchange and limit data theft. Furthermore, we investigate how data sovereignty can be maintained through cluster data exchange, which is crucial in an era where data is increasingly regulated and controlled. Additionally, we explore how offloading applications from the data consumer into the data producer cluster can match data gravity patterns, improving overall system efficiency. Finally, this paper presents the potential integration of the proposed solution within the framework of IDSA and Gaia-X, serving as promising option for implementing their proposed functionalities.},

abstract = {While working in the cloud, the trend is to secure all the resources in order for the applications and systems to operate as efficiently as possible. Huge amounts of resources are wasted on unnecessary utilities and resource-consuming processes, which can rather have a negative effect. Unikernels are the last trend in this direction. We aim to shed light on the motivations, benefits, and issues in unikernels. Our goal is to systematically analyze what made this technology so attractive, identifying the benefits they have attained and the issues encountered in embracing this new technology. We surveyed academic and grey literature by means of the Multivocal Literature Review process, analyzing 590 sources, of which 62 reported motivations, benefits, and issues. The main motivations for adopting unikernels are performance and security, which are also reflected in the benefits reported. In terms of issues, the maturity of the existing frameworks as well as the tool support, are the main challenges that need to be addressed. Given the great potential that unikernels can bring in terms of performance and security, further research is needed to investigate the pros and cons, how to use them, and in which contexts they are beneficial.},

This paper introduces LinkEdge, a set of tools that enable the integration of MLOps practices with edge devices. LinkEdge consists of two sets of tools: one for setting up infrastructure within edge devices to be able to receive, monitor, and run inference on ML models and another for MLOps pipelines to package models to be compatible with the inference and monitoring components of the respective edge devices. The LinkEdge platform is evaluated by obtaining a public dataset for predicting the breakdown of Air Pressure Systems in trucks. Additionally, the platform is compared against a commercial tool that serves similar purposes. The overall performance of LinkEdge matches that of already existing tools and services while allowing end users setting up Edge-MLOps infrastructure the complete freedom to set up their system without entirely relying on third-party licensed software.},

abstract = {As a fast and inexpensive machining method applicable for creating a wide range of shapes and producing large batches, sheet metal punching is widely used e.g., in automotive, aerospace, electronics, and construction industries. A significant downside of sheet metal punching is the punching tool wear in use. A worn punch tool may impact the quality of the end product by causing imperfections and reduce the efficiency of the manufacturing process through increased scrap and by slowing down the production. Effective monitoring of punching tool wear is therefore essential for an efficient and cost-effective production of high-quality parts. The monitoring can be based on acceleration measurement which produces large amounts of raw data, making edge processing ideal as only the indication of the tool condition needs to be sent forward for decision support. Classification models for tool wear identification were built and compared in this study. The models are based on measured acceleration data. Two different open-source methods for time series feature extraction, namely TSFEL and MiniRocket, were tested and the classification results based on them compared. All methods used for building the models are computationally light and therefore applicable for real-time data processing at the edge. According to the results the MiniRocket algorithm is suitable for the task and superior compared to the TSFEL method. The classification accuracies based on the MiniRocket features are at best over 96.5 % and at worst around 84 %, whereas the corresponding accuracies are between 35 and 56 % for TSFEL feature based models. The use of the MiniRocket algorithm in building a model for punch tool monitoring shows very promising results. However, the dataset used was very limited. Therefore, further investigation is required based on an ampler dataset.},

They play a crucial role laying the foundations to the organization and structure of software systems and have high impact on their quality and success both in terms of engineering and business aspects. Deciding for a concrete software architecture design requires careful analysis of several factors regarding the software system including system characteristics, constraints, required quality attributes and any trade-offs made along with the design decision; and hence is often not trivial. This paper presents a framework for architectural pattern selection and application that (i) supports the decision-making process of choosing an appropriate architectural pattern as well as (ii) the organization of the software structure based on the chosen pattern in an automated fashion when integrated within IDEs. In particular, the paper presents how this framework is implemented and integrated within an innovative open source cloud-native integration development environment.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a promising paradigm for applications distributed across the edge-cloud continuum. FaaS functions are stateless by nature, leading to high elasticity and transparent invocation. Supporting stateful applications, however, requires integrating data storage in FaaS, which is not trivial in an edge-cloud environment.We propose Enoki, an architecture for stateful FaaS computing replicated across the edge-cloud continuum. Enoki integrates a replicated key-value store with single-node FaaS systems at edge and cloud nodes in order to provide low-latency local data access for functions without breaking the abstraction of the FaaS programming model. We evaluate Enoki with microbenchmarks on an open-source prototype and demonstrate building a stateful FaaS application with multiple functions distributed over edge and cloud.},

abstract = {Highly Available systems often require sophisticated, expensive techniques. However, end-users may not have enough resources on their premises, or the knowledge to make their systems reach that goal. It may be fully impractical to expect an end-user to easily transform a regular application into a highly available one. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on Availability as a Service (AaaS). The proposed model has the potential to offer different levels of availability in a simplified fashion. AaaS has been often used to describe clouds that offer highly available services. Our proposal, on the other hand, is for the environment itself to provide, on demand, the functionality required for end-user systems to achieve specific levels of availability. We also envision that AaaS can go beyond the cloud. This includes the case in which AaaS is provided in a scenario we call Edge-Core-Cloud Continuum, where the network core plays a prominent role through NFV-COIN (Network Functions Virtualization - COmputing In the Network).},

This paper, for the first time, presents the design and integration of a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) in a pioneering real-time holo-portation platform, supporting realistic and volumetric user representations (i.e., 3D holograms), with the aim of overcoming such challenges. The feasibility and implications of adopting such an MCU, in comparison with state-of-the-art architectural approaches, are assessed through experimentation in two different deployment setups, by iteratively increasing the number of concurrent users in shared sessions. The obtained results are promising, as it is empirically proved that the newly adopted stream multiplexing together with the novel per-client and per-frame Volumetric Video (VV) processing optimization features provided by the MCU allow increasing the number of concurrent users, while: (i) significantly reducing resources consumption metrics (e.g., CPU, GPU, bandwidth) and frame rate degradation on the client side; and (ii) keeping the end-to-end latency within acceptable limits.},

This systematic review was conducted using an automated procedure that identified 44,903 records, which were filtered down to 93 studies. These articles are meant to better clarify the problem at hand and highlight the future areas in both research and industry in which MLOPs and AIOps are thriving. Our findings indicate that AIOps flourish in challenging circumstances like those presented by 5G and 6G technologies, whereas MLOps is more prevalent in traditional industrial environments. The use of AIOps in certain stages of the ML lifecycle, such as deployment, remains underrepresented in scientific literature.},

In this study, we shed light on several research challenges directly impacting the effective integration of distributed AR and edge computing. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments by deploying our distributed stream processing-based AR pipeline, scAtteR, on a representative edge-cloud infrastructure managed by the Oakestra framework. We uncover several unapparent challenges that inhibit the effective marriage of distributed AR when deployed on edge and demonstrate the potential improvements through scAtteR++. We offer valuable insights and best practices to the growing AR research community, specifically those interested in leveraging edge and public cloud technologies for large-scale AR operations.},

abstract = {Multiobjective optimization is a hot topic in the artificial intelligence and operations research communities. The design and development of multiobjective methods is a frequent task for researchers and practitioners. As a result of this vibrant activity, a myriad of techniques have been proposed in the literature to date, demonstrating a significant effectiveness for dealing with situations coming from a wide range of real-world areas. This paper is focused on a multiobjective problem related to optimizing Infrastructure-as-Code deployment configurations. The system implemented for solving this problem has been coined as IaC Optimizer Platform (IOP). Despite the fact that a prototypical version of the IOP has been introduced in the literature before, a deeper analysis focused on the resolution of the problem is needed, in order to determine which is the most appropriate multiobjective method for embedding in the IOP. The main motivation behind the analysis conducted in this work is to enhance the IOP performance as much as possible. This is a crucial aspect of this system, deeming that it will be deployed in a real environment, as it is being developed as part of a H2020 European project. Going deeper, we resort in this paper to nine different evolutionary computation-based multiobjective algorithms. For assessing the quality of the considered solvers, 12 different problem instances have been generated based on real-world settings. Results obtained by each method after 10 independent runs have been compared using Friedman's non-parametric tests. Findings reached from the tests carried out lad to the creation of a multi-algorithm system, capable of applying different techniques according to the user's needs.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things landscape has grown steadily over the last decade, fueling digital transformation. Data is now regarded as a precious asset. As a result, many companies have shifted their operations to the cloud to avoid maintaining massive infrastructure to hold and process all the data. However, in many settings, sending all the raw data to the cloud for processing and storage is not possible due to the unreliability of wide-area connectivity, coupled with the high costs of data transfer, storage, and processing. Also, some applications exhibit stringent response-time requirements. Edge computing can mitigate some of these issues, but it also has some drawbacks. This paper presents BlazeFlow, our vision of a multilayer data flow solution that can transport data to and from any layer of the cloud-to-device continuum based on publish-subscribe abstractions. BlazeFlow handles data flows between different services deployed onto the same node, between different devices of the same layer, and between different layers (edge, fog, and cloud). This is realized by a cross-layer common bridging solution that can automatically aggregate various protocols that are appropriate for each layer/device (e.g., ROS2, MQTT, Redis, and Kafka). BlazeFlow is designed to support bandwidth-intensive and time-critical services deployed at the various layers of the system. We evaluate a preliminary design of BlazeFlow over an autonomous robotics use case, and we show that it can sustain multi-layer data lows at a high frequency and with a low latency.},

abstract = {Edge cloud computing is a promising programming and deployment paradigm to empower delay-sensitive applications. By executing close to the network edge, distributed applications can have quicker reactions to event occurrence and consequently prompter dynamic adaptations. In addition, recent improvements in connectivity support allow developers to benefit from heterogeneous and alternative communication technologies (e.g., RDMA, DPDK, XDP, etc.) to meet the requirements of network-intensive edge applications. However, exploiting these technologies makes applications statically tailored to a specific network interface; this significantly limits the potential of edge cloud computing, where application components should be able to migrate seamlessly at runtime. INSANE aims at solving that issue by exposing a technology-agnostic middleware API that lets developers simply specify their QoS communication requirements; the dynamic selection of the most appropriate technology on the currently hosting edge node is delegated to INSANE. The paper also presents how it is possible to develop two different INSANE-based applications (a decentralized messaging system and an image streaming framework) with a few lines of code. Finally, an extensive performance evaluation shows that our middleware adds very limited ns-scale overhead to the raw acceleration technologies.},
